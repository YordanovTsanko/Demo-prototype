    "title": "Fe-Cr-Si NON-ORIENTED ELECTROMAGNETIC STEEL SHEET AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME",
    "abstract": "An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet contains 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si, 1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr, 0.006% by mass or less of C, 0.002% by mass or less of N, 0.005% by mass or less of S, 0.005% by mass or less of Ti, 0.005% by mass or less of Nb, and as necessary, 0.1% to 2% by mass of Al and at least one of 0.005% to 1% by mass of Sb and 0.005% to 1% by mass of Sn, and the balance being Fe and incidental impurities, wherein the electrical resistivity of the steel is 60μΩcm or more, and the number of nitrides contain- ing chromium per mm 2 in the interior of the steel sheet is 2,500 or less. Consequently, the problem that high electrical resistance resulting from the high Si content and high Cr content is not satisfactorily utilized is advan- tageously solved, and it is possible to provide a non- oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent magnetic properties in the high-frequency range, in particular; in a frequency range of 1 kHz or more.

Consequently, the problem that high\nelectrical resistance resulting from the high Si content\nand high Cr content is not satisfactorily utilized is advan-\ntageously solved, and it is possible to provide a non-\noriented electrical steel sheet having excellent magnetic\nproperties in the high-frequency range, in particular; in\na frequency range of 1 kHz or more.\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n2\nDescription\nTechnical Field\n[0001]The present invention relates to Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheets for high-frequency use\nwhich are suitable for iron cores of electric car motors, power generators for gas microturbines, high-frequency reactors,\netc. Herein, the term \"high-frequency range\" is defined as a frequency range of several hundred hertz or more, and in\nparticular, of about 400 Hz or more. The present invention more particularly relates to a steel sheet having excellent\nmagnetic properties in a high frequency range of 1 kHz or more.\nBackground Art\n[0002]Recently, devices used in the higher frequency ranges than conventionally used, for example, electric car\nmotors, gas microturbines, and high-frequency reactors, have been increasingly used, and there has been a demand\nfor electrical steel sheets having excellent magnetic properties in the high frequency range. These devices are used\nin a high frequency range of several hundred hertz to several tens of kilohertz.\n[0003]Conventionally, in such applications, Fe-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheets in which iron loss is\nimproved (i.e., iron loss is decreased) by adding Si to steel have been used. In general, a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet is cold-rolled so as to have a desired thickness, and is then recrystallized by final annealing to attain desired\nelectromagnetic properties.\n[0004]However, in the conventional Fe-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet for high-frequency use, the Si\ncontent in the steel is 3.5% by mass or less, and the electrical resistance of the steel is not so high. In particular, in a\nhigh frequency range of 1 kHz or more, the iron loss is high, which is disadvantageous. Therefore, in order to meet\nthe recent needs in society, development of new electrical steel sheets suitable for use in the high frequency range is\nabsolutely necessary.\n[0005]In order to improve iron loss in the high frequency range, it is considered to be particularly effective to improve\neddy current loss by increasing the electrical resistance of steel. In order to increase the electrical resistance of steel,\na technique is commonly used in which the Si or Al content in the steel is increased. However, if the Si content exceeds\n3.5% by mass, the steel becomes extremely hard and brittle, resulting in a deterioration in workability. Consequently,\nit becomes difficult to perform manufacture and working by ordinary rolling. Furthermore, in the conventional Fe-Si\nbased steel sheet, for example, if the Si content exceeds 5.0% by mass, it becomes impossible to perform not only\ncold working but also warm working.\n[0006]A technique for increasing the electrical resistance of steel by adding Cr, Al, etc., to steel without increasing\nthe Si content is disclosed in Patent Document 1. However, in the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, a fre-\nquency range of less than 1 kHz is assumed for use as in the conventional electrical steel sheet for high-frequency\nuse, and it is not possible to obtain sufficient high-frequency magnetic properties in a frequency range of 1 kHz or\nmore. Thus, the steel sheet disclosed in Patent Document 1 does not have a satisfactory effect as a non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet for high-frequency use suitable in the range of about 400 Hz to about 50 kHz required in recent\nyears. Additionally, the Si content in Patent Document 1 does not exceed that of a typical silicon steel sheet, and rather,\nPatent Document 1 mainly targets a low-silicon steel sheet with a Si content of about 1.5%.\n[0007]In contrast, the applicant of the present invention has found that by the addition of Cr, even in steel having a\nrelatively high Si content, brittleness is improved, and thus both high electrical resistance and high workability are\nobtained. The applicant of the present invention has proposed Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheets excellent in high-\nfrequency magnetic properties with a Cr content of 1.5% to 20% by mass and a Si content of 2.5% to 10% by mass in\nPatent Documents 2, 3, 4, etc.\n[Patent Document 1]: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-229095\n[Patent Document 2]: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-343544\n[Patent Document 3]: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-262289\n[Patent Document 4]: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2001-279326\nDisclosure of the Invention\n[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]\n[0008]In the steel sheets described in Patent Documents 2, 3, etc., superior iron loss is shown in response to high\nelectrical resistance in a frequency range of 10 kHz or more. On the other hand, it has been newly found that, although\nthese steel sheets have better iron loss compared with the conventional electrical steel sheet in a high-frequency range\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n3\nof less than 10 kHz, satisfactory iron loss measuring up to the high electrical resistance due to the high Si content and\nthe high Cr content is not obtained. Therefore, these steel sheets require further improvement.\n[0009]Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to advantageously solve the problem that the high electrical\nresistance obtained by the high Si content and the high Cr content is not sufficiently reflected to iron loss in a high-\nfrequency range of less than 10 kHz and to provide an Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having\nexcellent magnetic properties in the high-frequency range, in particular, in a frequency range of 1 kHz or more.\n[Means for Solving the Problems]\n[0010]As a result of intensive research into the problems described above, the present inventors have found that,\nalthough the percentage of eddy current loss in the iron loss is generally high in the high-frequency range, the influence\nof hysteresis loss is relatively large with respect to the Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet. It has been found that\nbecause of a deterioration of hysteresis loss, the decrease in eddy current loss due to high electrical resistance does\nnot sufficiently contribute to high-frequency magnetic properties. It has been discovered that in order to obtain improved\nhysteresis loss, it is necessary to control the frequency of nitrides containing chromium (nitrides including chromium)\nin the interior of the steel sheet. The present invention has been achieved based on the findings described above.\n[0011]The constituent features of the present invention are as follows:\n(1) An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency magnetic properties\ncontains 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si, 1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr, 0.006% by mass or less of C, 0.002% by mass\nor less of N, 0.005% by mass or less of S, 0.005% by mass or less of Ti, 0.005% by mass or less of Nb, and the\nbalance being Fe and incidental impurities, wherein the electrical resistivity of the steel is 60μΩcm or more, and\nthe number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\n in the interior of the steel sheet is 2,500 or less.\n(2) An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency magnetic properties\ncontains 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si, 1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr, 0.006% by mass or less of C, 0.002% by mass\nor less of N, 0.005% by mass or less of S, 0.005% by mass or less of Ti, 0.005% by mass or less of Nb, at least\none of more than 0.04% to 1% by mass of Sb and more than 0.06% to 1% by mass of Sn, and the balance being\nFe and incidental impurities, wherein the electrical resistivity of the steel is 60μΩcm or more, and the number of\nnitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\n in the interior of the steel sheet is 2,500 or less.\n(3) An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency magnetic properties\ncontains 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si, 1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr, 0.1% to 2% by mass of Al, 0.006% by mass or\nless of C, 0.004% by mass or less of N, 0.005% by mass or less of S, 0.005% by mass or less of Ti, 0.005% by\nmass or less of Nb, and the balance being Fe and incidental impurities, wherein the electrical resistivity of the steel\nis 60μΩcm or more, and the number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nin the interior of the steel sheet is\n2,500 or less.\n(4) An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency magnetic properties\ncontains 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si, 1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr, 0.1% to 2% by mass of Al, 0.006% by mass or\nless of C, 0.004% by mass or less of N, 0.005% by mass or less of S, 0.005% by mass or less of Ti, 0.005% by\nmass or less of Nb, at least one of 0.005% to 1% by mass of Sb and 0.005% to 1% by mass of Sn, and the balance\nbeing Fe and incidental impurities, wherein the electrical resistivity of the steel is 60μΩcm or more, and the number\nof nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\n in the interior of the steel sheet is 2,500 or less.\n(5) An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency magnetic properties\naccording to any one of the inventions (1) to (4) further contains at least one of 1% by mass or less of Mn and 1%\nby mass or less of P.\n(6) A method for producing an Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet having excellent high-frequency\nmagnetic properties includes the steps of casting molten steel containing 2.5% to 10% by mass of Si and 1.5% to\n20% by mass of Cr; subjecting the cast steel to rolling including cold rolling (including warm rolling, hereinafter the\nsame); and subjecting the resulting rolled steel sheet to final annealing, wherein the nitriding gas content in the\nfinal annealing atmosphere is controlled to less than 30 percent by volume in total in terms of nitrogen gas.\nHerein, contribution of the nitriding gas to nitriding is converted to the percent by volume in total in terms of\nnitrogen gas, which is calculated as follows.

The present\ninventors have studied the reasons for deterioration of hysteresis loss of Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheets.\n[0014]Each of steels 1 to 8 having the composition shown in Table 1 was subjected to hot rolling and cold rolling in\nthe usual manner so as to have a thickness of 0.25 mm, and was then subjected to final annealing.\n[0015]The final annealing conditions were set as follows. The annealing atmosphere was a nitrogen + hydrogen\natmosphere (N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:30 by volume ratio), and the annealing temperature was 980°C.\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n5\n[0016]As a result, in each of the steel sheets produced by subjecting steels 1 to 8 to final annealing under the\nconditions described above, fine nitrides containing chromium having a diameter of about several hundreds of nanom-\neters were observed in the steel. As an example, FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional SEM image, taken by a scanning electron\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n6\nmicroscope (SEM), of the interior of the steel sheet produced by subjecting steel 5 to final annealing under the conditions\ndescribed above. Additionally, the nitrides containing chromium are believed to be mainly composed of CrN, Cr\n2\nN, and\ncarbonitrides, such as Cr(C,N).\n[0017]Next, these steels with various Cr contents in the range of 1.0% to 4.5% by mass were subjected to final\nannealing under the conditions described above. The amount of nitriding during final annealing (difference in nitrogen\ncontent before and after final annealing) and the hysteresis loss were measured. FIG. 2 is a graph in which the Cr\ncontent in steel is plotted as abscissa and the amount of nitriding (in the entire steel sheet) during final annealing and\nthe hysteresis loss are plotted as ordinate to show the relationship therebetween. In FIG. 2, the bar chart represents\nthe amount of nitriding, and the line chart represents the hysteresis loss.\n[0018]As is evident from FIG. 2, as the Cr content in steel increases, the amount of nitriding during final annealing\nincreases, and the hysteresis loss deteriorates.\n[0019]From the results described above, it is considered that Cr in steel is easily precipitated as nitride containing\nchromium by nitriding during final annealing, and that the precipitation of the nitride containing chromium deteriorates\nhysteresis loss.\n[0020]Consequently, the present inventors have studied the means of inhibiting the precipitation of nitrides contain-\ning chromium during final annealing. As a result, it has been found that by annealing in an atmosphere, such as in an\nAr gas atmosphere, in which nitriding does not occur, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium can be inhibited. It\nhas also been found that by adding Sb and Sn, which are nitriding inhibitors, and/or Al, which is a nitride former, to a\nraw steel product, and by annealing in an atmosphere in which the nitrogen partial pressure is controlled to meet the\nSb, Sn, and Al contents, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium can be effectively inhibited. One example of this\nwill be described below.\n[0021]First, with respect to steel 10 having an Fe-Cr-Si alloy composition and containing 0.045% by mass of Sb\nshown in Table 1, a cold-rolled steel sheet was produced under the same conditions as those in the production method\ndescribed above, and the cold-rolled steel sheet was subjected to final annealing in two atmospheres (i.e., nitrogen:\nhydrogen = 70:30 and 95:5 by volume ratio).\n[0022]FIG. 3A is a cross-sectional SEM image showing the interior of the steel sheet subjected to final annealing\nin an atmosphere with a nitrogen:hydrogen ratio of 70:30, and FIG. 3B is a cross-sectional SEM image showing a\nregion near the surface of the steel sheet. The observation conditions were the same as those for FIG. 1. As is evident\nfrom FIGs. 3A and 3B, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium in a steel sheet portion 2 is inhibited by the addition\nof Sb. Reference numeral 1 in FIG. 3B represents a Cu foil for protecting the surface.\n[0023]With respect to the steel sheet subjected to final annealing in an atmosphere with a nitrogen:hydrogen ratio\nof 95:5, however, a considerable amount of nitrides containing chromium was observed in the grain boundaries. That\nis, even when annealing was performed in the atmosphere with the nitrogen:hydrogen ratio of 95:5, although the effect\nof inhibiting precipitation of nitrides containing chromium due to the addition of Sb was observed, the precipitation-\ninhibiting effect was insufficient.\n[0024]Next, with respect to steel 11 having an Fe-Cr-Si alloy composition and containing 0.55% by mass of Al shown\nin Table 1, final annealing was performed similarly in two atmospheres (i.e., nitrogen:hydrogen = 70:30 and 95:5). The\nother production conditions were the same as those in the production method described above.\n[0025]FIG. 4A is a cross-sectional SEM image showing the interior of the steel sheet subjected to final annealing\nin an atmosphere with a nitrogen:hydrogen ratio of 70:30, and FIG. 4B is a SEM image showing a region near the\nsurface of the steel sheet. As shown in FIG. 4B, an AIN layer 3 is formed on the outermost layer in the steel sheet,\nand precipitation of AIN 4 is observed in the region from the outermost layer to a depth of about 5μm. As a result, as\nshown in FIG. 4A, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium is inhibited in the interior of the steel sheet.\n[0026]In a final annealing atmosphere with a nitrogen:hydrogen ratio of 95:5, however, nitrides containing chromium\nwere present in the grain boundaries, and it was confirmed that the precipitation-inhibiting effect was insufficient.\n[0027]Furthermore, with respect to steels 4 and 6 containing substantially no Sb or Al shown in Table 1, cold-rolled\nsteel sheets were produced under the same conditions, and annealing was performed in an atmosphere containing\nonly an Ar gas. In such a case, it was also confirmed that nitriding of the steel was inhibited and precipitation of nitrides\ncontaining chromium was inhibited.\n[0028]When Sb and Al were added together (steel 12 in Table 1), by a similar experiment, it was confirmed that the\nsame effect of inhibiting precipitation of nitrides containing chromium as that in the case of addition of only Sb or Al\nwas obtained with a smaller amount of each added.\n[0029]Furthermore, an Fe-Cr-Si based alloy steel added with Sn was prepared separately, and a similar experiment\nwas carried out. As a result, it was confirmed that Sn had the same nitriding inhibiting effect as that of Sb.\n[0030]Table 2 shows the number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nin the interior of the steel sheet, the\namount of nitriding (in the entire steel sheet) after annealing, and the hysteresis loss measured with respect to non-\noriented electrical steel sheets produced using any one of steels 1 to 12. The atmosphere and temperature of final\nannealing are shown in Table 2, and the other production conditions were the same as those for the steel sheet shown\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n7\nin FIG. 1, etc.\n[0031]The number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nin the interior of the steel sheet was determined by the\nmethod described below.\n[0032]With respect to a cross section obtained by cutting the steel sheet in the thickness direction, multiple fields\nwere observed with a SEM (at a magnification of 1,000 to 10,000) so that the total observation area was 1 mm31\nmm. The number of nitrides containing chromium in the observation area was counted as the number of nitrides con-\ntaining chromium per mm\n2\n. In order to check whether the precipitates observed were Cr-containing nitrides or not,\nEDX was performed. The interior of the steel sheet is defined as a region excluding the region from the uppermost\nsurface to a depth of 5μm at each of front and back surfaces.\n[0033]Although observation was performed with respect to the cross section cut in the rolling direction (i.e., the\nsection in the rolling direction), no particular difference was observed in the number of particles depending on the\ncutting direction.\n[0034]FIG. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between the number of nitrides containing chromium in the interior\nof the steel sheet and the hysteresis loss. It has been found that in order to obtain satisfactory hysteresis loss, the\nnumber of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nmust be controlled to 2,500 or less. The present invention has been\nachieved based on the above finding.\n[0035]The non-oriented electrical steel sheets according to the present invention have the following characteristics.\n(a) Brittleness of high Si steel is improved by the addition of Cr, and thereby it becomes possible to produce high\nSi steel which has conventionally been difficult to produce, and higher electrical resistance is obtained.\n(b) Cr is effective not only in improving brittleness but also in increasing electrical resistance, and addition of Si\ntogether with Cr makes it possible to efficiently obtain high electrical resistance.\nTABLE 2\nSteel IDThickness\n(mm)\nFinal annealing conditionsAmount of\nnitriding (ppm)\nHysteresis\nloss Wh\n10/1k\n(W/kg)\nNumber of\nnitrides\ncontaining\nchromium (per\nmm\n2\n)\nAnnealing\natmosphere\n(by volume\nratio)\nAnnealing\ntemperature\n(°C)\n10.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309801819.71.23 10\n4\n20.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309802220.23.53 10\n4\n30.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309802620.97.03 10\n4\n40.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309803321.313 10\n5\n0.25Ar980-712.5< 100\n50.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309803522.53.13 10\n5\n60.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309803823.75.53 10\n5\n0.25Ar980-313.3< 100\n70.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309804424.283 10\n5\n80.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309804525.81.13 10\n6\n90.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:30980213.92,000\n100.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:30980013.41,000\n0.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 95:59801319.26,500\n110.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:309803412.9< 100\n0.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 95:59803119.57,500\n120.25N\n2\n:H\n2\n = 70:30980413.4< 100\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n8\n(c) By sufficiently decreasing the concentration of impurities, such as C, N, S, Ti, and Nb, the brittleness-improving\neffect due to the addition of Cr is obtained, and a deterioration of hysteresis loss due to precipitates can be pre-\nvented.\n(d) By annealing Cr-Si steel in an atmosphere, such as in an Ar gas atmosphere, in which nitriding does not occur,\nnitriding is inhibited, and the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated can be controlled to 2,500 per\nmm\n2\n or less, thus preventing a deterioration of hysteresis loss due to nitrides containing chromium.\n(e) By adding Sb and/or Sn, which are nitriding inhibitors, to an Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet and by ad-\njusting the nitriding gas content so as to be suited to the content of Sb and/or Sn, nitriding is inhibited during\nannealing, and the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated can be controlled to 2,500 per mm\n2\nor\nless, thus preventing a deterioration of hysteresis loss due to nitrides containing chromium.\n(f) By adding Al, which is a nitride former, to an Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet and by adjusting the nitriding\ngas content so as to be suited to the Al content, nitriding of the sheet interior is inhibited during annealing, and the\nnumber of nitrides containing chromium precipitated can be controlled to 2,500 per mm\n2\nor less, thus preventing\na deterioration of hysteresis loss due to nitrides containing chromium.\n(g) When both Sb and/or Sn, which are nitriding inhibitors, and Al, which is a nitride former, are added to an Fe-Cr-\nSi based electrical steel sheet, nitriding is inhibited during annealing as in the steel in which any one of Sb, Sn,\nand Al is added alone with a smaller amount of each added, and by further adjusting the nitriding gas content\nappropriately, the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated can be controlled to 2,500 per mm\n2\nor less,\nthus preventing a deterioration of hysteresis loss due to nitrides containing chromium.\n[0036]The present invention will be described in detail below.\n[0037]First, the reasons for limitations on the ranges of composition in the non-oriented electrical steel sheets of\nthe present invention will be described.\nSi: about 2.5% to about 10% by mass\nSi is a principal element for increasing the electrical resistance of steel. Furthermore, due to the synergic effect\nwith Cr, Si significantly increases electrical resistance, and in particular, Si is an effective element for improving\niron loss in the high frequency range. If the Si content is less than about 2.5% by mass, even if Cr is used together,\nonly an electrical resistance that is substantially the same as the electrical resistance of the conventional electrical\nsteel sheet is obtained, and thus it is not possible to obtain satisfactory iron loss in the high frequency range. On\nthe other hand, if the Si content exceeds about 10% by mass, even if Cr is added, toughness that normally allows\nthe steel to be rolled is not ensured. Therefore, the Si content is set at about 2.5% to about 10% by mass. The\nupper limit may be set at 10.0% by mass.\n[0038]The Si content is preferably in a range of about 2.5% to about 5.0%, and more preferably in a range of about\n3.5% to about 5.0%.\nCr: about 1.5% to about 20% by mass\nCr is a basic alloy element which significantly increases the resistivity of steel due to the synergic effect with Si,\nand which improves corrosion resistance. In order to obtain such effects, the Cr content must be about 1.5% by\nmass or more.\n[0039]Even when the Si content is about 3.5% by mass or more or the Si content is about 3% by mass or more and\nthe Al content exceeds about 0.5% by mass, Cr is significantly effective in achieving toughness that normally allows\nthe steel to be rolled. Although such an effect can be obtained at a Cr content of about 1.5% by mass or more, preferably,\nthe Cr content is about 2% by mass or more. Additionally, even when the Si content and the Al content are lower than\nthose described above, workability is improved by the addition of Cr. On the other hand, if the Cr content exceeds\nabout 20% by mass, the toughness-improving effect is saturated and cost increase occurs. Therefore, the Cr content\nis set at about 1.5% to about 20% by mass. The upper limit may be 20.0% by mass.\n[0040]The Cr content is preferably in a range of about 1.5% to about 5.0%.\n[0041]At least one of Sb: more than 0.04% to about 1% by mass and Sn: more than 0.06% to about 1% by mass\n(in the case when 0.1% by mass or more of Al is not added to steel)\n[0042]At least one of Sb: about 0.005% to about 1% by mass and Sn: about 0.005% to about 1% by mass (in the\ncase when 0.1% by mass or more of Al is added to steel)\n[0043]Since each of Sn and Sb has a nitriding-inhibiting effect, in steel containing these elements, precipitation of\nnitrides containing chromium can be effectively inhibited, compared with steel not containing Sn or Sb, even if the\npercentage of nitriding gas is high during final annealing. Since the precipitation of nitrides containing chromium due\nto nitriding during annealing is inhibited and deterioration of hysteresis loss is prevented, addition of Sn and/or Sb to\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n9\nan Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet produces a higher iron loss-improving effect compared with the conventional\nelectrical steel sheet. Consequently, in the present invention, in the case of an electrical steel sheet in which Al is not\nadded to steel (i.e., when the Al content is less than 0.1% by mass), at least one of more than 0.04% to about 1% by\nmass of Sb and more than 0.06% to about 1% by mass of Sn can be added. That is, if each of Sn and Sb exceeds 1%\nby mass, the effect described above is saturated and cost increase occurs. Therefore, the upper limit is set at 1% by\nmass. In order to produce the effect described above satisfactorily, the lower limits of the Sb and Sn contents are\nrespectively set at more than 0.04% by mass and more than 0.06% by mass. Additionally, the upper limit of each of\nthe Sb content and the Sn content may be set at 1.0% by mass.\n[0044]On the other hand, when Al is also added together with Sn and/or Sb (i.e., when the Al content is 0.1% by\nmass or more), at least one of about 0.005% to about 1% by mass of Sb and about 0.005% to about 1% by mass of\nSn can be added. If each of the Sn content and the Sb content exceeds about 1% by mass, the effect is saturated and\ncost increase occurs. Therefore, the upper limit is set at about 1% by mass. Additionally, the upper limit may be set at\n1.0% by mass.\n[0045]At a lower limit of about 0.005% by mass, due to the synergic effect with Al, the same effect as that described\nabove is produced. The lower limit may be set at 0.0050% by mass.\n[0046]Each of Sn and Sb has a texture-improving effect in addition to the nitriding-inhibiting effect, thereby further\ncontributing to improvement in magnetic properties of the steel sheet. Although addition of Sn or Sb in such a purpose\nis not prohibited in Patent Documents 3 and 4, neither document suggests the amount or method optimized for inhibiting\nnitriding.\n[0047]When Al is added together with Sn and/or Sb, each of the Sb content and the Sn content is more preferably\nabout 0.005% to about 0.05%.\nAl: about 0.1% to about 2% by mass\nAl is a stronger nitride former than Cr, bonds with nitrogen entering from the surface of the steel sheet during\nannealing, forms an AIN layer on the outermost layer in the steel sheet, and further precipitates AIN in the vicinity\nof the surface beneath the outermost layer. Thereby, penetration of nitrogen into the interior of the steel sheet is\nprevented, and as a result, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium due to nitriding in the interior of the steel\nsheet can be inhibited. Therefore, Al can be added to the steel as necessary. In the conventional electrical steel\nsheet, it was considered that precipitation of AIN at the surface of the steel sheet should be inhibited because of\ndeterioration of of magnetic properties. However, with respect to the Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet, it has\nbeen found that the precipitation of AIN is very effective in improving magnetic properties. Furthermore, because\nof the addition of Al, nitrogen contained in the steel since the casting operation forms coarse AIN, and thereby\nprecipitation of nitrides containing chromium due to nitrogen contained since the casting operation is also inhibited.\nThese effects are obtained by an Al content of about 0.1% by mass or more.\n[0048]Additionally, by adding an excessive amount of Al, electrical resistance can be increased, which is advanta-\ngeous, and for example, in Patent Documents 1, 2, 3, and 4, addition of Al for this purpose is encouraged. However,\nthe deterioration of magnetic flux density becomes larger compared with the case in which Si is added. Since an\nincrease in electrical resistance can be achieved by combined addition of Si and Cr, from the standpoint that both high\nelectrical resistance and high magnetic flux density are achieved, a lower Al content within the required range is pre-\nferred. Furthermore, since addition of an excessive amount of Al causes deterioration of toughness, a lower Al content\nis preferred in view of productivity. For the reasons described above, the upper limit of the Al content is set at about\n2% by mass. The upper limit may be set at 2.0% by mass. Therefore, the Al content is set at about 0.1% to about 2%\nby mass. Preferably, the Al content is set at about 0.10% to about 1.0% by mass.\n[0049]At least one of about 1% by mass or less of Mn and about 1% by mass or less of P\n[0050]By adding Mn and P, electrical resistance can be further increased, and further improvement in iron loss can\nbe achieved without impairing the purpose of the present invention. Consequently, at least one of Mn and P may be\nadded as necessary. However, if large amounts of these elements are added, workability is deteriorated. Therefore,\nthe upper limit of each of the Mn content and the P content is set at about 1% by mass. (The upper limit may be set\nat 1.0% by mass.) Preferably, each of the Mn content and the P content is 0.5% by mass or less. Additionally, since a\nvery small amount of Mn or P can provide the effect, it is not necessary to particularly set the lower limit. For example,\nan Mn content of about 0.04% by mass or more and a P content of about 0.01% by mass or more are sufficient.\nC: about 0.006% by mass or less\nSince C deteriorates the toughness of the Fe-Cr-Si based electrical steel sheet, the C content is desirably de-\ncreased as much as possible. In the compositional range of the present invention, the C content must be sup-\npressed to about 0.006% by mass or less. Furthermore, in view of preventing the deterioration of hysteresis loss\ndue to precipitates of Cr-containing carbides and the like, the C content must also be suppressed to about 0.006%\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n10\nby mass or less. The upper limit may be set at 0.0060% by mass. The C content is preferably about 0.0040% or less.\n[0051]Although not adding C is theoretically acceptable, about 10 ppm of C is considered to remain in reality.\n[0052]A steel ingot with a target C content may be cast. Alternatively, a steel ingot with about 0.006% to about 0.02%\nby mass of C used as a starting material may be subjected to C content reduction, such as intermediate annealing\nduring cold rolling, or final annealing after cold rolling, conducted as a decarbonization annealing.\nN: about 0.002% by mass or less (in the case when 0.1% by mass or more of Al is not added to steel) about 0.004%\nby mass or less (in the case when 0.1% by mass or more of Al is added to steel)\nN readily bonds with Cr to precipitate nitrides containing chromium. Consequently, in view of deterioration of hys-\nteresis loss, in the case of an electrical steel sheet in which Al is not added to steel (Al < 0.1% by mass), the N\ncontent must be reduced to about 0.002% by mass or less. The upper limit may be set at 0.0020% by mass.\n[0053]On the other hand, in the case of an electrical steel sheet in which Al is added to steel (Al≥0.1% by mass),\nN bonds with Al, and precipitation of nitrides containing chromium due to nitriding and nitrogen in steel is inhibited.\nConsequently, an N content of about 0.004% by mass or less is acceptable. However, since an increase in the N\ncontent causes deterioration of toughness, the N content is desirably reduced as much as possible. From the standpoint\nof deterioration of toughness, the N content must also be reduced to about 0.004% by mass or less. The upper limit\nmay be set at 0.0040% by mass.\n[0054]Although not adding N is theoretically acceptable, about 10 ppm of N is considered to remain in reality.\nS: about 0.005% by mass or less\nS produces precipitates, such as MnS and CuS, and deteriorates hysteresis loss. Consequently, in view of im-\nprovement in hysteresis loss, the S content must be reduced to about 0.005% by mass or less. The upper limit\nmay be set at 0.0050% by mass. Preferably, the S content is about 0.0025% by mass or less. Although not adding\nS is theoretically acceptable, about 5 ppm of S is considered to remain in reality.\nTi: about 0.005% by mass or less, Nb: about 0.005% by mass or less\nTi and Nb are considered as workability-improving components in ordinary Cr-containing steel. However, Ti and\nNb deteriorate magnetic properties. In the present invention, since workability is improved by the addition of Cr\nand reductions in the contents of C and N, workability improvement capabilities of Ti and Nb are not required.\nTherefore, in view of magnetic properties, the contents of Ti and Nb are desirably reduced as much as possible.\nThe contents of Ti and Nb each must be reduced to about 0.005% by mass or less. The upper limit may be set at\n0.0050% by mass. Preferably, each of the Ti content and the Nb content is about 0.0020% or less. Although not\nadding (below analytical limit of detection) these elements is theoretically acceptable, about 5 ppm each of Ti and\nNb is considered to remain in reality.\n[0055]With respect to incidental impurities, such as O, V, and Cu, in view of magnetic properties and workability,\nthe contents thereof are desirably reduced as much as possible. Preferably, the contents of O, V, and Cu are, respec-\ntively, 0.0050% by mass or less, 0.0050% by mass or less, and 0.050% by mass.\n[0056]Examples of the other incidental impurities include B, Ni, Zr, Ca, and Mg. Preferably, the Ni content is 0.05%\nby mass or less, and the contents of the other elements are 0.0050% by mass or less.\n[0057]In order to improve high-frequency characteristics, it is very effective to increase electrical resistance of steel.\nIn the present invention, preferably, steel has an electrical resistivity of at least about 60μΩcm. If the electrical resistivity\nis less than 60μΩcm, high-frequency magnetic properties are not sufficiently obtained. Further, the electrical resistivity\nof less than 60μΩcm is easily attained by a conventional electrical steel sheet in which Cr is not positively added.\nMore preferably, the electrical resistivity is about 70μΩcm or more.\n[0058]Since the electrical resistivity is mainly determined by the composition of steel, the target value is obtained\nby designing the composition with known influences of the individual elements in mind or by simple test.\n[0059]As shown in FIG. 5, in order to obtain satisfactory hysteresis loss, the number of nitrides containing chromium\nper mm\n2\nin the interior of the steel sheet must be controlled to 2,500 or less. If the number of particles exceeds 2,500\nper mm\n2\n, the hysteresis loss rapidly deteriorates, and it is not possible to obtain satisfactory high-frequency iron loss.\n[0060]The number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nis controlled to 2,500 or less by the addition of Sn and\nSb, which are nitriding inhibitors, or Al, which is a nitride former, and further by increasing the proportion of non-nitriding\ngas in the final annealing atmosphere. Of course, this can be achieved by a 100% non-nitriding gas atmosphere.\n[0061]Examples of the non-nitriding gas include H\n2\ngas and Ar gas. Examples of practically usable nitriding gas\ninclude N\n2\n gas and NH\n3\n gas.\n[0062]With respect to steel having a composition in which nitriding inhibitors Sn and Sb or nitride former Al are not\nadded, it is suitable to perform annealing in a non-nitriding atmosphere not containing a nitriding gas. The number of\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n11\nnitrides containing chromium can also be reduced by greatly decreasing the proportion of nitriding gas.\n[0063]Next, processes for producing non-oriented electrical steel sheets of the present invention will be described\nbelow.\n[0064]First, molten steel having a composition according to any one of the claims of the present invention is cast\ninto a slab, and the slab is heated and then subjected to ordinary hot rolling. The slab heating temperature is not\nparticularly limited, but is preferably set in a range of about 950°C to about 1,200°C because production problems,\nsuch as sagging of the slab, may occur if the slab is heated at high temperatures. By setting the thickness of the hot-\nrolled sheet to be extremely small, the rolling property of the steel sheet in the subsequent cold rolling step can be\nimproved. On the other hand, if the thickness is excessively small, the rolling machine may fail in its ability to follow\nthe decreased thickness or the shape of the hot-rolled sheet may become defective. Therefore, the thickness of the\nhot-rolled sheet is preferably in a range of about 2.5 mm to about 0.5 mm.\n[0065]Subsequently, hot-rolled sheet annealing may be performed. The hot-rolled sheet annealing treatment is ef-\nfective in improving magnetic properties. If the annealing temperature is less than 800°C, the effect is insufficient. If\nthe annealing temperature exceeds 1,200°C, the texture becomes too coarse, resulting in a toughness problem. There-\nfore, preferably, hot-rolled sheet annealing is performed in a temperature range of about 800°C to about 1,200°C.\n[0066]The resultant hot-rolled sheet is then cold-rolled so as to have a final thickness. The cold rolling process may\nbe performed one time to obtain the final thickness. Alternatively, the cold rolling process may be divided into two or\nmore operations with intermediate annealing being interposed therebetween. The intermediate annealing treatment is\neffective in improving magnetic properties, removes strain from the steel sheet, and reduces the load in the subsequent\ncold rolling process. However, after strain is removed and recrystallization is completed, intermediate annealing dete-\nriorates the toughness of the steel sheet. That is, intermediate annealing at extremely high temperatures not only\nsaturates the effect but also produces coarse grains, thus degrading the cold rolling property of the steel sheet in the\nsubsequent step. On the other hand, if the temperature is excessively low, the effect of improving magnetic properties\nbecomes insufficient. Therefore, the intermediate annealing temperature is preferably in a range of 700°C to 1,100°C.\n[0067]The more the C content is reduced, the more magnetic properties and workability are improved. Consequently,\nthe intermediate annealing process may be performed in an oxidizing atmosphere so that decarbonization is carried out.\n[0068]Furthermore, the cold rolling process may be performed as warm rolling at a temperature in a range of about\n100°C to about 300°C within which it is known that a magnetic improving effect is produced.\n[0069]A typical production process has been described above. However, the production process is not limited there-\nto. Any process in which cast steel is subjected to working, finally by cold rolling or warm rolling, so as to have a final\nthickness may be performed under appropriate conditions.\n[0070]The cold-rolled steel sheet which has been subjected to cold rolling (or warm rolling) is then subjected to final\nannealing to induce recrystallization. The final annealing process may be continuous annealing or box annealing.\nPreferably, continuous annealing is performed.\n[0071]In the final annealing step for a non-oriented electrical steel sheet, a reducing atmosphere composed of ni-\ntrogen gas or including nitrogen gas as a main component mixed with hydrogen gas is generally used.\n[0072]In the steel of the present invention, as already mentioned above, control of the atmosphere during final\nannealing is important. In order to inhibit nitriding and to control the number of nitrides containing chromium per mm\n2\nto 2,500 or less, for example, annealing is preferably performed in an atmosphere, such as in an Ar gas atmosphere,\nin which nitriding does not occur. Alternatively, Sb and Sn, which are nitriding inhibitors, and/or Al, which is a nitride\nformer, may be added to a raw steel product, and the fraction of nitriding gas may be appropriately controlled to meet\nthe contents of these additives. That is, in the present invention, the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated\nper mm\n2\nis controlled to 2,500 or less by increasing the percentage of hydrogen gas in an atmosphere composed of\nnitrogen and hydrogen gases, or by replacing at least a part of nitrogen gas with the other gas, such as Ar gas. In\nparticular, with respect to steel having the composition in which nitriding inhibitors Sn and Sb and nitride former Al are\nnot added, the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated per mm\n2\nis controlled to 2,500 or less by not using\nnitrogen gas in the annealing atmosphere or by reducing the percentage of nitrogen gas to a significantly low fraction.\n[0073]Specifically, when the atmosphere is controlled, with respect to steel having the composition in which Al, Sb,\nand Sn are not added, the nitriding gas content in the atmosphere is controlled to less than 30 percent by volume in\ntotal in terms of nitrogen gas (hereinafter simply referred to as \"percent by volume in total\"). With respect to steel having\nthe composition other than that described above, the nitriding gas content is controlled to less than 95 percent by\nvolume in total. If the nitriding gas content is too high, it becomes difficult to control the precipitates due to nitriding,\nand further, the surface of the steel sheet is oxidized, resulting in a deterioration of hysteresis loss.\n[0074]With respect to the nitriding gas content, the percent by volume in total in terms of nitrogen gas is calculated\nas follows. As the fraction of nitrogen N, the atomic ratio is determined from the chemical composition of each nitriding\ngas. The resulting ratio is multiplied by the volume percentage of each nitriding gas, and the total sum is calculated.\n[0075]For example, when N\n2\n:NH\n3\n:H\n2\n= 40:40:20, since NH\n3\nconsists of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen\natoms, the fraction of nitrogen N in NH\n3\ngas is 0.25. Therefore, the percent by volume in total in terms of nitrogen gas\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n12\nis calculated as follows: 40% + (40%3 0.25) = 50%.\n[0076]In the case of N\n2\ngas, of course, the fraction of nitrogen is 1. Consequently, when the nitriding gas is composed\nof nitrogen gas only, the percent by volume of the nitrogen gas in the entire atmosphere corresponds to the percent\nby volume in total.\n[0077]Furthermore, the nitriding ability is higher in higher-temperature annealing, and the effect of controlling the\natmosphere is more remarkable when the final annealing temperature is higher than a temperature range of about\n900°C to 950°C. Preferably, controlling of the atmosphere is optimized appropriately based on the actual amount of\nnitriding at each final annealing temperature.\n[0078]For example, in the final annealing temperature range from about 700°C to less than 950°C, since the nitriding\nability is not so high, in order to reduce the number of nitrides containing chromium to the predetermined value or less,\nthe percent by volume in total of the nitriding gas is preferably set at less than 95% with respect to steel in which at\nleast one of Sb, Sn, and Al is added, and at less than 30% with respect to steel in which Sb, Sn, and Al are not added.\n[0079]In the final annealing temperature range from 950°C to about 1,150°C, since the nitriding ability is very high,\npreferably, the percent by volume in total of the nitriding gas is set to be lower than that in the case of low-temperature\nannealing. In such a case, the percent by volume in total of the nitriding gas is preferably set at about 80% or less with\nrespect to steel in which at least one of Sb, Sn, and Al is added, and at about 15% or less with respect to steel in which\nSb, Sn, and Al are not added.\n[0080]In view of cost and productivity, preferably, an appropriate amount of nitrogen gas is added to the atmosphere.\nWith respect to steel in which at least one of Sb, Sn, and Al is added, nitrogen gas can be added to such a degree that\nthe percent by volume in total of the nitriding gas is about 60% or more without problems. With respect to steel in which\nSb, Sn, and Al are not added, nitrogen gas can be added to such a degree that the percent by volume in total of the\nnitriding gas is about 5% or more.\n[0081]In the steel sheet of the present invention, if the thickness is decreased, the effect of improving high-frequency\nmagnetic properties is accelerated. In order to obtain a remarkable effect of the decrease in thickness, preferably, the\nthickness is set at about 0.4 mm or less. However, if the thickness is smaller than about 0.01 mm, the production cost\nincreases. Therefore, the thickness is preferably in a range of about 0.01 to about 0.4 mm.\n[EXAMPLES]\n(Example 1)\n[0082]Steels each containing the composition shown in Table 3 and the balance being Fe and incidental impurities\nwere cast, the resulting slabs were heated at 1,150°C and hot-rolled to produce hot-rolled sheets with a thickness of\n2.0 mm. Next, steels A to P and W were subjected to hot-rolled sheet annealing at 1000°C, and the final thickness\nwas set at 0.25 mm by a single cold rolling process. On the other hand, steels Q to V were not subjected to hot-rolled\nsheet annealing, and the final thickness was set at 0.15 mm by a double cold rolling process including intermediate\nannealing at 900°C. Each steel sheet was subjected to final annealing at 980°C to 1,040°C for 10 seconds. The resulting\nsteel sheet was cut into an Epstein sample and magnetic properties thereof were evaluated. The measurement was\nperformed in accordance with JIS C 2550.\n[0083]The electrical resistivity, thickness of the product, atmosphere gas in final annealing, annealing temperature,\niron loss, amount of nitriding in the entire steel sheet after annealing, amount of nitriding in the interior of the steel\nsheet, nitrogen content in the interior of the steel sheet, and the number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated\nare summarized in Tables 4 to 7.\n[0084]The nitrogen content in the interior of the steel sheet is defined as a nitrogen content in a region obtained by\nremoving a potion by a depth of 5μm from each of front and back surfaces of the steel sheet by chemical polishing.\nThe amount of nitriding in the interior of the steel sheet corresponds to a difference between the nitrogen content in\nthe entire steel sheet before final annealing and the nitrogen content in the interior of the steel sheet after final annealing.\nThe amount of nitriding in the entire steel sheet corresponds to a difference between the nitrogen content in the entire\nsteel sheet before final annealing and the nitrogen content in the entire steel sheet after final annealing. The nitrogen\ncontent was measured by wet chemical analysis. The number of nitrides containing chromium precipitated was exam-\nined using cross-sectional SEM images with a magnification of 5,000.\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n13\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n14\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n15\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n16\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n17\n[0085]With respect to steels A and B to which Cr is not added, since the electrical resistivity is out of the range of\nthe present invention, the reduction in iron loss is insufficient. With respect to steels D, M, and W in which the nitrogen\ncontent in steel is out of the range of the present invention, even if Al, Sn, or Sb is added, nitrides containing chromium\nare precipitated, and the iron loss is unsatisfactory.\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n18\n[0086]With respect to steels C, K. and Q to which Al, Sb, and Sn are not added, when the percentage of nitriding\ngas (herein, the nitrogen partial pressure) is not controlled, nitrides containing chromium are precipitated due to nitriding\nduring annealing, and the iron loss is unsatisfactory. On the other hand, when the nitrogen partial pressure is controlled\nto be low by setting the annealing atmosphere to be an Ar atmosphere or a low-nitrogen atmosphere, precipitation of\nnitrides containing chromium is inhibited, and satisfactory iron loss is shown.\n[0087]With respect to steels E, F, L, R, and V to which at least one of Sn and Sb is added, when the annealing\natmosphere is controlled within the range of the present invention, precipitation of nitrides containing chromium and\nsurface oxidation of the steel sheet are inhibited, and satisfactory iron loss is shown. On the other hand, when the\natmosphere is not controlled and annealing is performed with high nitrogen partial pressure, the nitriding-inhibiting\neffect due to the addition of Sn and/or Sb becomes insufficient, the amount of precipitation of nitrides containing chro-\nmium is not controlled within the range of the present invention, and the iron loss is unsatisfactory.\n[0088]With respect to steels G, H, P, and T to which Sb and Sn are not added and Al is added, since AlN is formed\non the outermost layer in the steel sheet due to nitriding, the nitrogen content after annealing is increased. However,\nbecause of the formation of AIN, the nitrogen content in the interior of the steel sheet is not increased. Therefore, when\nthe annealing atmosphere is controlled besides the addition of Al, nitriding is inhibited and satisfactory iron loss is\nshown. On the other hand, when the atmosphere is not controlled and annealing is performed with high nitrogen partial\npressure, the nitriding-inhibiting effect due to the addition of Al becomes insufficient, precipitation of the nitrides con-\ntaining chromium is not controlled within the range of the present invention, and the iron loss is unsatisfactory.\n[0089]With respect to steels I, J, N, O, S, and U to which Sn and/or Sb and Al are added in combination, precipitation\nof nitrides containing chromium due to nitriding is inhibited because of the inhibition of nitriding by the addition of Sn\nand/or Sb and the formation of AIN on the outermost surface in the steel sheet by the addition of Al, and satisfactory\nmagnetic properties are shown. On the other hand, when the atmosphere is not controlled, and annealing is performed\nwith high nitrogen partial pressure, the nitriding-inhibiting effect due to the addition Sn and/or Sb and Al in combination\nbecomes insufficient, the amount of precipitation of nitrides containing chromium is not controlled within the range of\nthe present invention, and the iron loss is unsatisfactory.\n[0090]With respect to steels to which at least one of Sn, Sb, and Al is added, of course, satisfactory iron loss is\nshown even when annealing is performed in a 100% non-nitriding atmosphere, such as in an Ar atmosphere, in which\nnitriding does not occur.\n(Example 2)\n[0091]With respect to steels Q, R, S, and T shown in Table 3, the final thickness was set at 0.15 mm by the process\ndescribed in Example 1, final annealing was then performed at 900°C for 10 seconds, and the iron loss at a higher-\nfrequency range was evaluated.

Similarly, with respect to steels R, S, and T to which at least one of Al, Sn, and Sb is added, when annealing\nis performed with high nitrogen partial pressure without controlling the atmosphere, the nitriding-inhibiting effect due\nto the addition of Al, Sn, and Sb becomes insufficient, the amount of precipitation of nitrides containing chromium is\nnot controlled within the range of the present invention, and iron loss is unsatisfactory.

The steel sheets of the present invention are most suitable for devices used in the high-fre-\nquency range, for example, electric car motors, power generators for gas microturbines, and high-frequency reactors,\nand the industrial values thereof are great.\nClaims\n1.An Fe-Cr-Si based non-oriented electrical steel sheet comprising:\n2.5% to 10% by mass of Si;\nTable 8   (continued)\nSteel IDElectrical\nresistivity\n(μΩcm)\nThickness\n(mm)\nFinal annealing conditionsIron loss\nW\n0.5/20k\n (W/\nkg)\nNumber of\nnitrides\ncontaining\nchromium\nprecipitated\n(per mm\n2\n)\nRemarks\nAnnealing\natmosphere\nAnnealing\ntemperature\n(°C)\nR85.820.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=70:\n30\n9008.64< 100EP\n85.820.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=85:\n15\n9008.68< 100EP\n85.820.15N\n2\n9009.757,000CE\nS89.20.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=70:\n30\n9008.43< 100EP\n89.20.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=50:\n50\n9008.39< 100EP\n89.20.15H\n2\n9008.29< 100EP\n89.20.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=90:\n10\n9008.62500EP\nT88.150.15N\n2\n:H\n2\n=70:\n30\n9008.55< 100EP\n88.150.15Ar9008.46< 100EP\n88.150.15N\n2\n9009.686,000CE\nCE: Comparative Example EP: Example of Present invention\n\nEP 1 577 413 A1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n20\n1.5% to 20% by mass of Cr;\n0.006% by mass or less of C;\n0.002% by mass or less of N;\n0.005% by mass or less of S;\n0.005% by mass or less of Ti;\n0.005% by mass or less of Nb;

For this reason, from the viewpoint of product\ncore loss or from the viewpoint of the simplification of production and raising productivity, steel sheet with better crystal\ngrain growth characteristics in the finish annealing is therefore desired.\n[0004]On the other hand, electrical steel sheet is stamped by the consumer for use for producing cores. The smaller\nthe grain size, the better the stamping precision in the stamping operation. The grain size is therefore, for example, 40\nPm or less.\n[0005]Therefore, sometimes the measure is taken of shipping the product sheet with the small grain size, then having\nthe consumer stamp it, then for example perform stress relief annealing at 750°C\u00162 hours or so to grow the crystal grains.\n[0006]In this case, consumers increasingly demand product sheets with good growth potential of the crystal grains\neven with low temperature, short time stress relief annealing so as improve productivity.\n[0007]One of the primary factors that obstruct crystal grain growth is the inclusions finely dispersed in the steel. It is\nknown that the greater the number of inclusions contained in the product and the smaller their size, the more the crystal\ngrain growth is obstructed.\n[0008]That is, as indicated by Zener, the smaller the r/f value as expressed by the spherical equivalent radius r of the\ninclusions and the volume fraction f of the inclusions in the steel, the worse the crystal grain growth. Consequently, in\norder to improve the crystal grain growth, the number of inclusions must, of course, be reduced and it is critical to increase\nthe size of the inclusions.\n[0009]As fine inclusions that obstruct crystal grain growth of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, oxides such as\nsilica and alumina, sulfides such as manganese sulfide, and nitrides such as aluminum nitride and titanium nitride are\nknown.\n[0010]In order to eliminate these fine inclusions or decrease them to the necessary and sufficient level, it is self-\nevident that the purity should be increased at the molten steel stage.\n[0011]However, eliminating these fine inclusions or decreasing them to the necessary and sufficient level by increasing\nthe purity at the molten steel stage is not preferable since an increase in the steelmaking cost is unavoidable.\n[0012]Therefore, as other methods, several methods are known of adding various elements to the steel ensure to\nrender the inclusions harmless.\n[0013]For the oxides, technological advances have made it possible to eliminate and render harmless oxides at the\nmolten steel stage by adding a sufficient amount of the strong deoxidizing element Al and allowing sufficient time for the\nflotation and removal of oxides.\n[0014]For the sulfides, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 51-62115, Japanese Patent\nPublication (A) No. 56-102550, Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 59-74212, Japanese Patent No. 3037878, etc., the\nmethod is known of adding rare earth elements (below called \"REM\"), which are desulfurization elements, etc. so as to\nincrease the size of S inclusions and render them harmless.\n[0015]Further, for nitrides, as disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 1167896 or JP-A-55077320 and Japanese Patent\nNo. 1245901 or US4439251, the method for rendering N harmless as coarse inclusions by the addition of B is well known.\n[0016]Further, US-B1-6290783 discloses the addition of Ti and Zr in controlled amounts together with REMs for\neffective precipitation of nitrides on REM oxide or REM sulfide. Nevertheless, TiN is known to adhere on REM-oxysulfides\nas EP-A1-1632582 reveals.\n[0017]However, even if using the above stated methods to eliminate oxides, sulfides, and nitrides of non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet or increase the size of the inclusions to render them harmless and then perform the finish annealing\nor stress relief annealing, the crystal grains will partially vary in growth and fine crystal grains and coarse crystal grains\nwill be mixed together sometimes leading to poor core loss.\n[0018]The cause, it has been found, is the fine titanium carbides (below called \"TiC\"), derived from the Ti and C which\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nhad been in solid solution at the stage of the finish annealing or stress relief annealing, precipitating at parts of the\nproduct sheet and obstructing the growth of the crystal grains. This will be explained specifically below.\n[0019]Non-   oriented electrical steel sheet is often treated by finish annealing or stress relief annealing at a comparatively\nlow temperature of 1000°C or less. In particular, stress relief annealing is performed at 750°C or so or at a further lower\ntemperature to prevent wear of the surface coating of the product sheet.\n[0020]Therefore, in order to sufficiently grow crystal grains at such a low temperature, it is necessary to perform the\nannealing over a long time of 1 hour or more.\n[0021]With annealing at this low temperature and long time, it is difficult to control the temperature of the product\nsheet to become uniform over the entire surface at all times. Parts of the product sheet become lower in temperature,\nwhile other parts become higher in temperature, i.e., a variation often occurs in the temperature distribution.\n[0022]Incidentally, when TiC precipitates in electrical steel, it has been learned from separate studies that it precipitates\nwithin a range of 700 to 800°C, particularly actively precipitates at 750°C or less.\n[0023]Consequently, in annealing at a low temperature over a long time, at the parts where the temperature of the\nproduct sheet becomes relatively high, the precipitation temperature of TiC is exceeded, so TiC does not precipitate.\nFurther, since these parts are high in temperature, the crystal grain growth rate is also fast. Therefore, the crystal grains\nof these parts become coarse in size.\n[0024]On the other hand, at the parts where the temperature of the product sheet becomes relatively low, the tem-\nperature is less than the precipitation temperature of TiC, so TiC precipitates during the annealing.\n[0025]In particular, the TiC produced under a low temperature, due to the low temperature, cannot grow to TiC of a\nsufficient size and becomes fine, so obstructs crystal grain growth during annealing over a long time.\n[0026]Since the TiC particles precipitating in this case are fine, even if the amount of Ti and the amount of C contained\nin the steel are high ones of several ppm, sometimes a number of TiC particles sufficient for obstructing crystal grain\ngrowth will precipitate.\n[0027]Furthermore, at the parts where the temperature of the product sheet is relatively low, due to the low temperature,\nthe growth rate of the crystal grains itself is slow and therefore the effect of the fine TiC particles obstructing crystal grain\ngrowth becomes stronger. Therefore, the crystal grains do not sufficiently grow and remain fine.\n[0028]In this manner, the reduction of the annealing temperature or the unavoidable variation in the annealing tem-\nperature causes variation in presence of TiC in the electrical steel sheet and consequently variation in crystal grain\ngrowth in the electrical steel sheet.\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n[0029]The.present invention has as its object the provision of non-oriented electrical steel sheet enabling sufficient\ngrowth of crystal grains and reduction of core loss by suppressing the precipitation of the fine TiC which had somewhat\ninevitably been generated at the low temperature parts during finish annealing or stress relief annealing.\n[0030]Features of the present invention for achieving this object are included in claim 1 and they comprise:\n(1) Non-oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss characterized by containing, by mass%, C: 0.01% or\nless, Si: 0.1% to 7.0%, Al: 0.1% to 3.0%, Mn: 0.1% to 2.0%, N: 0.005% or less, Ti: over 0.0015 to 0.02%, REM:\n0.05% or less, S: 0.005% or less, O: 0.005% or less, and a balance of iron and unavoidable impurities and having\na mass% of S shown by [S], a mass% of O shown by [O], a mass% of REM shown by [REM], a mass% of Ti shown\nby [Ti], and a mass% of N shown by [N] satisfying [Formula 1] and [Formula 2]: \n(2) Non-oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss according to (1) characterized by further containing, by\nmass%, at one least one of P: 0.5% or less, Cu: 3.0% or less, Ca and Mg: 0.05% or less, Cr: 20% or less, Ni: 5.0%\nor less, a total of one or both of Sn and Sb: 0.3% or less, Zr: 0.01% or less, V: 0.01% or less, and B: 0.005% or less.\n(3) Non-oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss according to (1) or (2), characterized by further containing,\nby mass%, Ti: over 0.0015% to 0.02% and REM: 0.00075% to 0.05% and having a mass% of REM shown by [REM]\nand a mass% of Ti shown by [Ti] satisfying [REM]\u0017[Ti]≥0.5.\n(4) Non-oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss according to any one of (1) to (3), characterized in that\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet contains REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures and having a size of 1\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nPm to 5 Pm and in that the ratio of the number of REM oxysulfides bonded with TiN in the REM oxysulfides having\ncracks or fractures and having a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm is 5% or more.\n[0031]According to the present invention, it is possible to sufficiently suppress fine TiC precipitating in non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, possible to maintain good crystal grain growth at the finish annealing or stress relief annealing\nstage, and obtain sufficiently good magnetic properties.

Further, the precipitation start temperature\nof TiC is 700 to 800°C. The fact that precipitation starts actively in particular at 750°C or less is clear from separate studies.\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0043]For this reason, in the cooling process of casting or the cooling process after slab reheating and other conditions\nof a comparatively high temperature, Ti coprecipitates as TiN with the REM oxysulfides and is fixed.\n[0044]Once Ti is fixed as TiN, TiN will not redissolve in the relatively low temperature state of the finish annealing of\nthe product sheet or stress relief annealing after stamping, so the Ti necessary for the precipitation of TiC in the product\nsheet is consumed and consequently TiC will not precipitate.\n[0045]Consequently, the REM oxysulfides in the steel are formed more selectively than other REM inclusions. If\nsetting suitable conditions enabling TiN to coprecipitate with this, Ti can be fixed in the form of TiN coprecipitated on the\nREM oxysulfides and the action of TiC on obstructing crystal grain growth can be reduced.\n[0046]Precipitation of REM oxysulfides involves the solubility product of the component elements REM, O, and S.\nThat is, for the precipitation of REM oxysulfides, the value expressed in the form of the product of the amount of REM,\nthe amount of O, and the amount of S in the steel (solubility product) has to exceed a predetermined value.\n[0047]On the other hand, in regards to Ti, it is necessary that TiN precipitate and sufficiently grow. In particular, to\nenable the Ti in steel to be fixed as TiN, it is necessary that Ti and N for growing TiN be sufficiently contained in the steel.\n[0048]Precipitation of TiN involves the solubility product of the component elements Ti and N. That is, for the precip-\nitation of TiN, the solubility product expressed in the form of the product of the amount of Ti and the amount of N in the\nsteel must exceed a predetermined value.\n[0049]However, when adjusting the amount of Ti and the amount of N in the steel to become excessive so as to\nincrease the value expressed in the form of the product of the amount of Ti and the amount of N, all of the Ti and N in\nsteel will not be fixed as TiN on the REM oxysulfides, and excess Ti and excess N failing to form TiN will end up remaining.\nDue to this, sometimes TiC and AIN or other precipitates will form and conversely the crystal grain growth will be\nobstructed.\n[0050]Therefore, the solubility product of Ti and N must be kept to a ratio of a certain value or less with respect to\nthe solubility product of REM, O, and S.\n[0051]Note that the REM oxysulfides in the steel are lower in hardness than the steel, so if the steel is rolled, forged,\nor otherwise processed, they will be stretched or will be crushed and form cracks or fractures.\n[0052]After the processing, which form the REM oxysulfides take and which extent of cracks and fractures occur will\nvary according to the processing conditions. However, according to the ordinary method of production of electrical steel\nsheet, usually at least one-third of the REM oxysulfides in the steel will have cracks or fractures.\n[0053]Before the steel is processed in the above way, the REM oxysulfides sometimes are covered on their surfaces\nwith compounds other than TiN (for example, AIN and the like) bonded to them. However, when the above processing\ncauses the surfaces of the REM oxysulfides to crack or fracture, since compounds other than TiN will not be bonded to\nthe cracks or fractures, TiN will be easily formed.\n[0054]For this reason, the cracks or fractures of the REM oxysulfides are more amendable to coprecipitation of TiN\nthan surfaces of the REM oxysulfides other than the cracks or fractures.\n[0055]The REM oxysulfide shown in FIG. 3 is comprised of a spherical REM oxysulfide to the surface of which TiN\nparticles are bonded. Further, the REM oxysulfide shown in FIG. 4 is a semispherical shape of the originally spherical\nREM oxysulfide broken in half vertically. A large number of TiN particles are bonded to the right side of the fracture.\n[0056]As clear from a comparison of FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the cracks or fractures of REM oxysulfides have greater\nnumbers of TiN bonded to them in a stacked manner and have TiN particles grown to a larger size compared with\nsurfaces other than the cracks or fractures.\n[0057]In this way, the cracks or fractures of REM oxysulfides have larger, greater number of TiN particles bonded to\nthem compared with surfaces other than the cracks or fractures.\n[0058]That is, the fact that REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures fix a greater amount of Ti and have a stronger\neffect of suppressing TiC precipitation compared with REM oxysulfides without cracks or fractures was newly discovered\nby the present inventors.\n[0059]Still further, the fact that if a certain ratio of number of REM oxysulfides among the REM oxysulfides having\ncracks or fractures have TiN coprecipitated on them, the Ti will be more sufficiently fixed and the effect of suppression\nof precipitation of TiC during annealing will be made stronger was newly discovered by the present inventors.\n[0060]Note that TiN also coprecipitates on REM oxysulfides that do not have cracks or fractures, but the amount of\nTi fixed due to this, as mentioned above, is smaller than with the REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures.\n[0061]Consequently, if considering the effect of suppression the TiC precipitation, including REM oxysulfides having\ncracks or fractures in the steel is more advantageous.\n[0062]Such REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures, as explained above, are obtained by the crushing of REM\noxysulfides which were substantially spherical before crushing due to the processing of the steel.\n[0063]As explained above, according to the usual method of production of electrical steel sheet, usually at least one-\nthird of the REM oxysulfides in the steel have cracks or-fractures, but in other cases, sometimes even if processing the\nsteel, REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures will not be formed and the REM oxysulfides which were substantially\nspherical before crushing will remain as is in the steel.\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0064]In particular, if the size of the REM inclusions is less than 1 Pm, cracks or fractures are difficult to form. On the\nother hand, REM inclusions having a size of over 5 Pm often become a size of 5 Pm or less due to stretching or crushing.\n[0065]Consequently, the ratio of number of REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures should be considered for\nparticles of a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm. Here, the \"size\" means the spherical equivalent diameter.\n[0066]Considering the above, the inventors engaged in intensive studies and as a result discovered that when the\nmass% of S shown by [S], the mass% of O shown by [O], the mass% of REM shown by [REM], the mass% of Ti shown\nby [Ti], and the mass% of N shown by [N] satisfy the [Formula 1] and [Formula 2], REM oxysulfides are formed in the\nsteel and TiN coprecipitates on the surfaces of the REM oxysulfides whereby Ti is fixed as TiN and the formation of TiC\nis suppress. \n[0067]Further, they discovered that if the steel contains REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures, when the ratio\nof number of REM oxysulfides bonded with TiN among the REM oxysulfides of a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm having cracks or\nfractures is 5% or more, a larger amount of Ti is fixed on the REM oxysulfides as TiN and the effect of suppression of\nthe formation of TiC is strengthened more.\n[0068]Note that when the amount of Ti in the steel is excessive, not all of the Ti in the steel will be fixed as TiN in the\nREM inclusions. The excess Ti failing to form TiN will remain and due to this TiC will sometimes be formed.\n[0069]Therefore, it is believed necessary that the amount of Ti be kept to a certain ratio or less of the amount of REMs.\n[0070]Therefore, the inventors engaged in intensive studies and as a result discovered that if the steel includes REM\ninclusions having cracks or fractures, when the ratio of the REM inclusions bonded with TiN among the REM inclusions\nof a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm having cracks or fractures is 5% or more and the mass% of REM shown by [REM] and the\nmass% of Ti shown by [Ti] satisfies [REM]\u0017[Ti]≥0.5, Ti is sufficiently fixed at the REM inclusions as TiN and the formation\nof TiC can be suppressed.\n[0071]Below, the suitable ranges of ingredients described above will be explained in more detail using Table 1, Table\n2, and FIG. 1 to FIG. 4.\n[0072]Steels containing, by mass%, C: 0.0026%, Si: 3.0%, A1: 0.59%, and Mn: 0.21% and changed variously in the\ncontents of O, S, Ti, N, and REM as shown in Table 1 were continuously cast and hot rolled. The hot rolled sheets were\nannealed, cold rolled to a thickness of 0.35 mm, finish annealed at 850°C\u001630 seconds, and coated with an insulating\nfilm to prepare product sheets. The grain size of the product sheets was in each case within the range of 30 to 34 Pm.\n[0073]Next, these product sheets were stress relief annealed at 750°C\u00161.5 hours or a shorter time than the conven-\ntionally generally performed stress relief annealing. After this, they were examined for inclusions, grain size, and magnetic\nproperties. The results are shown in Table 2\n[0074]Note that in Table 2, \"broken REM inclusions with TiN (%)\" means the ratio of REM oxysulfides of a size of 1\nPm to 5 Pm with TiN coprecipitated among those having cracks or fractures.\n[0075]Further, the ratios of numbers of REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures with respect to the total numbers\nof REM oxysulfides in the steels were within the range of 35 to 65%.\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTable 1\nNo.\ncomposition\nC (mass%)   Si (mass%)   Mn (mass%)   Al (mass%)   Ti (mass%)   S (mass%)   O (mass%)   N (mass%)   REM (mass%)\n1 *\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0012 *\n0.0039\n0.0042\n0.0021\n0.0019\n2\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0021\n0.0014\n0.0017\n0.0020\n0.0044\n3\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0016\n0.0020\n0.0009\n0.0020\n0.0049\n4\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0039\n0.0020\n0.0015\n0.0020\n0.0052\n5\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0045\n0.0020\n0.0022\n0.0020\n0.0090\n6\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0197\n0.0010\n0.0011\n0.0044\n0.0035\n7\n0.0026\n3.0\n021\n0.59\n0.0089\n0.0002\n0.0009\n0.0023\n0.0263\n8\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0026\n0.0006\n0.0007\n0.0048\n0.0019\n9\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0109\n0.0008\n0.0011\n0.0037\n0.0020\n10\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0195\n0.0014\n0.0005\n0.0043\n0.0037\n11\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0011\n0.0015\n0.0004\n0.0023\n0.0015\n12\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0014\n0.0006\n0.0005\n0.0020\n0.0024\n13\n0.0026\n3.0\n0.21\n0.59\n0.0022\n0.0005\n0.0004\n0.0020\n0.0030\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0076]As shown in Nos. 1 to 7, when the [REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S] value of the steel was within the range of [Formula 1] and\nthe ([REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S])\u0017([Ti]\u0016[N]) value was within the range of [Formula 2], the grain size after stress relief annealing,\nwas 59 to 72 Pm, that is, the grains grew sufficiently, and the magnetic property (core loss: W15/50) was a good 1.85\nto 1.94 W/kg.\n[0077]These steels contained REM oxysulfides. Further, as shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, TiN coprecipitated on the\nsurfaces of the REM oxysulfides. In addition, TiC was not formed after annealing.\n[0078]From the above results, it is clear that when the ingredients of the product are within the ranges prescribed by\nthe present invention, the REM in the steel forms REM oxysulfides, TiN coprecipitates on that whereby the Ti is fixed,\nand formation of TiC is suppressed.\n[0079]Further, in particular, as shown by Nos. 2 to 5, when the steel sheet contained REM oxysulfides of a size of 1\nPm to 5 Pm having cracks or fractures and the ratio of the number of REM oxysulfides bonded with TiN among them\nwas 5% or more, the grain size after stress relief annealing was 66 to 72 Pm, that is, the grains grew further, and the\nmagnetic property (core loss: W15/50) was a better 1.85 to 1.90 W/kg.\n[0080]These steels contained REM oxides, REM sulfides, and REM oxysulfides. Among them, the inclusions of a\nsize of 1 Pm to 5 Pm having cracks or fractures, as shown in FIG. 4, were observed to include a larger number of REM\noxysulfides bonded with TiN. It was clear that the fixation of Ti was further strengthened. Further, after annealing, TiC\nwas not formed in the product.\n[0081]Note that as shown in FIG. 2, it is important that the ratio of the number of REM oxysulfides bonded with TiN\namong the REM oxysulfides of a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm having cracks or fractures be 5% or more, but in this case, the\nlarger the value, the more remarkable the effect. 20% or more is preferable, while 30% or more is more preferable.\n[0082]The examples shown by Nos. 11 to 13 are cases where the [REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S] values are outside the range of\n[Formula 1]. REM oxysulfides were not observed in these steels. In addition, TiC could be observed. Due to this, crystal\ngrain growth was obstructed. The grain size after stress relief annealing remained between 34 to 36 Pm. The W15/50\nvalue was around 2.3 W/kg, i.e., was poor.\n[0083]In this case, REM oxysulfides were not observed in the steel. Consequently, TiN did not coprecipitate on the\nsurfaces of the REM oxysulfide to fix the Ti, so the Ti precipitated as TiC in the stress relief annealing and obstructed\ncrystal grain growth.\nTable 2\nNo.\n[REM]\n2\n[O\n]\n2\n[S]\n[REM]\n2\n[O\n]\n2\n[S]/\n[Ti] [N]\n[REM]/\n[Ti]\nbroken \nREM \ninclusions \nwith TiN \n(%)\nREM-O-S\nTiN on \nREM-O-S\nTiC\ngrain \ndiameter \nafter \nannealing \n[Pm]\nW15/50 \nafter \nannealing \n[W/kg]\n12.5x10\n-13\n9.9x10\n-8\n1.584.8yesyesno641.92\n27.8x10\n-14\n1.9x10\n-8\n2.105.5yesyesno721.87\n33.9x10\n-14\n1.2x10\n-8\n-95yesyesno701.85\n41.2x10\n-13\n1.6x10\n-8\n-50yesyesno661.90\n57.8x10\n-13\n8.7x10\n-8\n-67yesyesno671.87\n61.5x10\n-14\n1.7x10\n-10\n0.18-yesyesno591.94\n71.1x10\n-13\n5.5x10\n-9\n2.96-yesyesno691.91\n81.1x10\n-15\n8.5x10\n-11\n--yesnoyes382.23\n93.9x10\n-15\n9.6x10\n-11\n--yesnoyes412.20\n10   4.8x10\n-15\n5.7x10\n-11\n--yesnoyes37229\n11   5.4x10\n-16\n2.1x10\n-10\n--non.a.yes36225\n12   8.6x10\n-18\n3.1x10\n-10\n--non.a.yes342.30\n13   72x10\n-16\n1.6x10\n-10\n--non.a.yes352.31\n-: not measured n.a.: not applicable\n* : outside the scope of invention\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0084]Due to the above, it became clear that the [REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S] value must be within the range of [Formula 1].\n[0085]The examples shown by Nos. 8 to 10 are cases where the [REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S] values are within the range of\n[Formula 1], but the ([REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S])\u0017([Ti]\u0016[N]) values are outside the range of [Formula 2].\n[0086]REM oxysulfides were observed in these steels. However, TiN could not be observed on the surfaces of the\nREM oxysulfides. In addition, TiC was observed. Due to this, crystal grain growth was obstructed. The grain size after\nstress relief annealing remained between 37 to 41 Pm, and the W15/50 value was approximately 2.2 to 2.3 W/kg, i.e.,\nwas poor.\n[0087]In this case, while REM oxysulfides were formed in the steel, TiN was not coprecipitated on the surfaces to fix\nthe Ti. The Ti precipitated finely dispersed as TiC during stress relief annealing and obstructed crystal grain growth.\n[0088]Due to the above, it became clear that the [REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S] must be within the range of [Formula 1] and the\n([REM]\n2\n\u0016[O]\n2\n\u0016[S])\u0017([Ti]\u0016[N]) value must be within the range of [Formula 2].\n[0089]Note that it should be especially mentioned here, that when for example the amount of Ti is small such as in\nNo. 11 and the like, conversely TiC is sometimes formed\n[0090]According to conventional findings, the amount of Ti is preferably extremely small, so it was considered nec-\nessary to prevent the entry of Ti into the steel even with tremendous effort, but in the case of the present invention, great\neffort is not required for reducing the amount of Ti. In some cases, it is possible to positively add Ti to raise the amount\nof Ti in the steel from the amount of Ti unavoidably entering it so as to positively make TiN coprecipitate on the surfaces\nof the REM oxysulfides.\n[0091]In the present invention, this coprecipitation enables Ti to be fixed, precipitation of TiC during the annealing to\nbe eliminated, and good product characteristics to be stably obtained\n[0092]Further, in the cases of Nos. 1, 2, and 7 where the mass% of REM shown by [REM] and the mass% of Ti shown\nby [Ti] are within the range of [REM]\u0017[Ti]≥0.5, the grain size after stress relief annealing was 67 to 72 Pm, i.e., the grains\nsufficiently grew, and the magnetic property (core loss: W15/50) was a good 1.87 to 1.92 W/kg.\n[0093]Note that the above results are results when performing the stress relief annealing in a shorter time than the\nconventionally performed stress relief annealing, but in the case of performing the conventional level of stress relief\nannealing, the difference in crystal grain growth due to the pinning action of the fine inclusions becomes more remarkable,\nso the above stated crystal grain growth potential and suitability of core loss become further clearer of course.\n[0094]Further, the above was explained by the crystal grain growth potential in stress relief annealing after stamping\nwhere the effect of TiC particularly easily appears, but the same applies even in finish annealing of the cold rolled sheet\nbefore stamping.\n[0095]In addition, so long as the element is REM, the above effect is exhibited if in the range prescribed in the present\ninvention whether using just one type or two types or more in combination.\n[0096]Next, the reasons for limitation of the preferable contents of the ingredients in the present invention will be\nexplained.\n[0097][C]: C is not only harmful to the magnetic properties, but the precipitation of C results in remarkable magnetic\naging, so the upper limit was made 0.01 mass%. The lower limit includes 0 mass%.\n[0098][Si]: Si is an element which decreases core loss. If less than the lower limit of 0.1 mass%, core loss becomes\nworse, so the lower limit was made 0.1 mass%. Further, if over the upper limit of 7.0 mass%, the processability becomes\nremarkably poor, so the upper limit was made 7.0 mass%.\n[0099]Note that Si has the effect of raising the active amount of Ti in the steel, so if Si is higher, Ti precipitates are\nmore actively formed, coprecipitation of TiN to REM oxysulfides is promoted more, the amount of Ti fixed per REM\noxysulfide particle increases, and the numerical density of fine Ti precipitates in the steel is reduced more.\n[0100]This effect is generally proportional to the square of the amount of Si, so the amount of Si is preferably higher.\nSpecifically, the numerical density of fine Ti precipitates of a size of 100 nm or less in the steel becomes 1\u001610\n9\n/mm\n3\nor less when the amount of Si is 2.2 mass% and becomes 5\u001610\n8\n/mm\n3\n or less when the amount of Si is 2.5 mass%.\n[0101]Consequently, the lower limit of the amount of Si is preferably 2.2 mass%, more preferably 2.5 mass%.\n[0102]Further, a more preferable value as the upper limit of the amount of Si is 4.0 mass% where the cold rollability\nis better. If the upper limit is 3.5 mass%, the cold rollability becomes even better, so this is more preferable.\n[0103][Al]: Al is an element which, like Si, decreases core loss. If less than the lower limit of 0.1 mass%, the core loss\nworsens, while if over the upper limit of 3.0 mass%, the cost remarkably increases. The lower limit of Al, from the viewpoint\nof core loss, is preferably 0.2 mass%, more preferably 0.3 mass%, still more preferably 0.6 mass%.\n[0104][Mn]: Mn is added in an amount of 0.1 mass% or more to increase the hardness of the steel sheet and improve\nthe stampability. Note that the upper limit of 2.0 mass% is based on economic reasons.\n[0105][N]: N becomes nitrides such as AlN and TiN and causes core loss to become worse. N is fixed in REM inclusions\nas TiN, but the practical upper limit is made an upper limit of 0.005 mass%.\n[0106]Note that due to the above reasons, the upper limit is preferably 0.003 mass%, more preferably 0.0025 mass%,\nstill more preferably 0.002 mass%.\n[0107]Further, due to the above reasons, N is preferably as small as possible, but making it approach close to 0\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n10\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nmass% results in great industrial restrictions, so the lower limit is made over 0 mass%.\n[0108]Note that the practical limit is set to 0.001 mass% as a general rule. If reducing the amount to 0.0005 mass%,\nthe nitrides are suppressed, which is more preferable, while if reducing them to 0.0001 mass%, it is even more preferable.\n[0109][Ti]: Ti forms fine inclusions such as TiC, causes the crystal grain growth potential to deteriorate, and causes\nthe core loss to worsen. Ti is fixed as TiN in the REM oxysulfides, but the practical upper limit was made an upper limit\nof 0.02 mass%.\n[0110]Note that due to the above reasons, the upper limit is preferably 0.01 mass%, more preferably 0.005 mass%.\n[0111]Further, Ti is an element which causes the crystal grain growth potential to deteriorate, so the smaller the\namount the better. The lower limit is made over 0 mass%. However, as explained above, if the amount of Ti is too small,\nthe effect of being fixed at the REM oxysulfides is sometimes not realized.\n[0112]Consequently, when the amount of Ti satisfies the above evaluation formula [Formula 2], if the amount of Ti is\nover 0.0012 mass%, the effect of fixation at the REM oxysulfides becomes more reliable. By over 0.0015 mass%, it is\nmore reliable, further, if 0.002 mass% or more, it is more preferable, further, if 0.0025 mass% or more, it is still more\npreferable.\n[0113][REM]: REM forms oxysulfides to fix S and suppress the formation of fine sulfides other than REM oxysulfides.\nFurther, it becomes the site for coformation of TiN and exhibits the effect of fixing the Ti.\n[0114]For this reason, a content exceeding the amount required in accordance with the amount of Ti becomes\nnecessary, but if 0.001 mass% or more, the above effect becomes more reliable so this is preferred. 0.002 mass% or\nmore is more preferable, 0.0025 mass% or more is still more preferable, and 0.003 mass% or more is even more\npreferable.\n[0115]Note that when casting molten steel with a content over the upper limit of 0.05 mass%, the REM oxysulfides\nin the molten steel become excessive, a large number of REM oxysulfides stick to the refractory walls of the molten\nsteel channels in the casting system, and the molten steel channels are sometimes clogged. For this reason, the upper\nlimit of REMs is made 0.05 mass%.\n[0116][S]: S becomes sulfides such as MnS, causes the crystal grain growth potential to deteriorate, and causes the\ncore loss to worsen. S is fixed as REM oxysulfides, but the practical upper limit was made an upper limit of 0.005 mass%.\n[0117]Further, due to the above reasons, S is preferably as small as possible, but reducing it to close to 0 mass%\nresults in great industrial restrictions. Further, it is necessary for forming REM oxysulfides. Therefore, the lower limit was\nmade over 0 mass%.\n[0118]Note that the lower limit was made 0.0005 mass% as a general rule as a practical lower limit considering\neconomy.\n[0119][O]: If O is included in an amount greater than 0.005 mass%, a large number of oxides are formed. These\noxides obstruct domain wall displacement and crystal grain growth. Consequently, O is preferably made 0.005 mass%\nor less.\n[0120]In addition, due to the above reasons, O is preferably as small as possible, but reducing it to close to 0 mass%\nresults in great industrial restrictions. Further, it is necessary for forming REM oxysulfides. Therefore, the lower limit was\nmade over 0 mass%.\n[0121]Note that the lower limit was made 0.0005 mass% as a general rule as a practical lower limit considering\neconomy.\n[0122]Elements other than the above stated ingredients which do not greatly obstruct the effects of the steel of the\npresent invention may be contained in the steel of the present invention.\n[0123]Below, the optional elements will be described. Note that the lower limits of the contents are all made over 0\nmass% because it is sufficient if these are included in even trace amounts.\n[0124][P]: P increases the strength of the material and improves processability. However, if excessive, the cold\nrollability is impaired, so the content is made 0.5 mass% or less, more preferably 0.1 mass% or less.\n[0125][Cu]: Cu increases corrosion resistance and raises resistivity to improve the core loss. However, if excessive,\nscars etc. are formed on the surface of the product sheet and the surface quality is harmed, so the content is 3.0 mass%\nor less, more preferably 0.5 mass% or less.\n[0126][Ca] and [Mg]: Ca and Mg are desulfurization elements. They react with the S in the steel to form sulfides and\nthereby fix the S. However, unlike REMs, they have little effect of causing coprecipitation of TiN.\n[0127]If increasing the amounts added, the desulfurization effect is strengthened, but if over the upper limit of 0.05\nmass%, grain growth is obstructed by the excessive sulfides of Ca and Mg. Consequently, 0.05 mass% or less is\npreferable.\n[0128][Cr]: Cr increases corrosion resistance and raises resistivity to improve the core loss. However, excessive\naddition raises the costs, so 20 mass% was made the upper limit.\n[0129][Ni]: Ni promotes the formation of a texture structure advantageous to the magnetic properties and improves\nthe core loss. However, excessive addition raises the costs, so 5.0 mass% was made the upper limit. Preferably 1.0\nmass% is the upper limit.\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n11\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0130][Sn] and [Sb]: Sn and Sb are segregation elements. They obstruct the formation of a texture structure of the\n(111) plane degrading the magnetic properties and thereby improve the magnetic properties.\n[0131]These elements may be used alone or may be used in combinations of two types. The above effect is exhibited\nin both cases. However, if in excess of 0.3 mass%, the cold rollability deteriorates, so 0.3 mass% was made the upper limit.\n[0132][Zr]: Zr obstructs crystal grain growth even in trace amounts and cause core loss to worsen after stress relief\nannealing. Consequently, it is preferable to reduce it as much as possible to 0.01 mass% or less.\n[0133][V]: V forms nitrides and carbides and obstructs domain wall displacement and crystal grain growth. For this\nreason, it is preferably made 0.01 mass% or less.\n[0134][B]: B is a grain boundary segregation element. Further, it forms nitrides. These nitrides obstruct grain boundary\nmigration and cause the core loss to worsen. Consequently, it is preferable to reduce it as much as possible to 0.005\nmass% or less.\n[0135]Next, the preferable manufacturing conditions in the present invention and the reasons for setting them will be\nexplained. First, at the steelmaking stage, when refining by a steel converter or secondary refining furnace or other\nordinary method, the degree of oxidation of the slag, that is, the mass ratio of (FeO+MnO) in the slag, is made 1.0 to 3.0%.\n[0136]The reason is that if the degree of oxidation of the slag is less than 1.0%, the activity of Ti rises due to the effect\nof Si within the range of the amount of Si of the electrical steel, so it is difficult to effectively prevent reintroduction of Ti\nfrom the slag and the amount of Ti in the steel will unnecessarily rise. On the other hand, if the degree of oxidation of\nthe slag is over 3.0%, REM oxysulfides in the molten steel will unnecessarily be oxidized by the oxygen supply from the\nslag and become REM oxides and therefore the S in the steel will not sufficiently be fixed.\n[0137]Furthermore, at the steelmaking stage, the basicity of the slag, that is, the ratio of the mass% of CaO to the\nmass% of SiO\n2\n in the slag, is preferably 0.5 to 5\n[0138]The reason is that if the basicity of the slag is less than 0.5, reintroduction of Ti from the slag will become large,\nthe amount of Ti in the steel will easily unnecessarily rise, and the amount of addition of REM for fixing the Ti will become\ngreater. On the other hand, if the basicity of the slag exceeds 5, the reintroduction of S from the slag will become large,\nthe amount of S in the steel will easily unnecessarily rise, and the amount of addition of REM for fixing the S will become\ngreater. In each case, it becomes economically disadvantageous.\n[0139]Further, it is also important to consider the furnace refractories etc. and eliminate as much of the oxidation\nsources as possible. Furthermore, to secure sufficient time for the REM oxides unavoidably formed when adding REMs\nto float up, the time from addition of REMs to casting is preferably made 10 minutes or more.\n[0140]The above stated measures are used to produce the molten steel of the desired composition, then the steel is\ncontinuously cast or cast into ingots to obtain slabs and other cast pieces.\n[0141]After this, furthermore, the slabs are hot rolled and if necessary the hot rolled sheets are annealed and cold\nrolled once or twice or more with process annealing in between to finish them to the product thickness, then are finish\nannealed and coated with an insulating film.\n[0142]Using the above method, the inclusions in the product sheet can be controlled to within the range prescribed\nby the present invention.\n[0143]At this time, if making the reduction rate of the hot rolling higher, the REM inclusions in the steel will more easily\nbe stretched or crushed and cracks or fractures will more easily occur, so this is preferable.\n[0144]Note that if adjusting the distribution of the reduction rate to become higher at the rear stage side of the rolling,\nthe shear force will more effectively act to cause the REM inclusions in the steel to crack or fracture, so this is preferable.\n[0145]At this time, as the sheet thickness of the product is predetermined, in order to increase the reduction rate, a\nthicker slab becomes necessary. Therefore, there is a lower limit value to the required slab thickness.\n[0146]When considering the fact that the general product sheet thickness of non-oriented electrical steel sheet is 0.2\nto 0.7 mm or so, the slab thickness is preferably 50 mm or more, more preferably 80 mm or more, still more preferably\n100 mm or more, and even more preferably 150 mm or more.\n[0147]Further, when TiN coprecipitates at the cracks or fractures of the REM inclusions, it is possible to adjust the\ntemperature history so that the TiN bonds to at least 5% of the number of the REM inclusions of a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm\nhaving cracks or fractures. For example, the sheet is held in the temperature range of 1000°C for 15 minutes or more.\n(Examples)\n[0148]Steel containing, by mass%, C: 0.0026%, Si: 3.0%, Al: 0.59%, and Mn: 0.21% and changed in contents of O,\nS, TiN, and REM as shown in Table 1 were continuously cast and hot rolled and the hot rolled sheets were annealed\nand cold rolled to thicknesses of 0.35 mm.\n[0149]Next, the sheets were finish annealed at 850°C\u001630 seconds and coated with an insulating film to produce the\nproduct sheets, then were annealed by stress relief annealing at 750°C\u00161.5 hours, then examined for inclusions in the\nproduct sheets, examined for grain size, and examined for magnetic properties by the 25 cm Epstein method.\n[0150]For the examination of inclusions, the inclusions were extracted by the replica method, then observed by using\n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n12\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\na TEM. The grain size was measured by mirror polishing the cross-section of the sheet thickness and applying Nital\netching to bring out the crystal grains and measuring the average grain size.\n[0151]As clear from Table 1 and Table 2, in the product sheets according to the present invention, good effects are\nobtained in regards to crystal grain growth and core loss values. On the other hand, in the product sheets outside the\nrange prescribed by the present invention, inferior results are obtained in regards to crystal grain growth and core loss\nvalues.\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n[0152]As described above, by suitably controlling the inclusions included in non-oriented electrical steel sheet, it is\npossible to stably obtain good magnetic properties even with simple annealing.\n[0153]In particular, even by simple stress relief annealing, it becomes possible to stably obtain good magnetic prop-\nerties. The needs of the consumers can be satisfied and energy savings can be contributed to.\n[0154]Consequently, the present invention has great industrial applicability in industries relating to electrical steel\nsheet.\nClaims\n1.Non-   oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss characterized by containing, by mass%, C: 0.01% or less,\nSi: 0.1% to 7.0%, Al: 0.1% to 3.0%, Mn: 0.1% to 2.0%, N: 0.005% or less, Ti: over 0.0015% to 0.02% RFM: 0.05%\nor less, S: 0.005% or less, O: 0.005% or less, optionally at one least one of P: 0.5% or less, Cu: 3.0% or less, Ca\nand Mg: 0.05% or less, Cr: 20% or less, Ni: 5.0% or less, a total of one or both of Sn and Sb: 0.3% or less, Zr: 0.01%\nor less, V: 0.01% or less, and B: 0.005% or less and a balance of iron and unavoidable impurities and having a\nmass% of>< S shown by [S], a mass% of O shown by [O], a mass% of REM shown by [REM], a mass% of Ti shown\nby [Ti], and a mass% of N shown by [N] satisfying [Formula 1] and [Formula 2]: \nwherein the non-oriented electrical steel sheet after final annealing and before stress relief annealing contains REM\noxysulfides having cracks or fractures and having a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm and in that the ratio of the number of REM\noxysulfides bonded with TiN in the REM oxysulfides having cracks or fractures and having a size of 1 Pm to 5 Pm\nis 5% or more.\n2.Non-   oriented electrical steel sheet superior in core loss according to claim 1, characterized by containing, by\nmass%, REM: 0.00075% to 0.05% and having a mass% of REM shown by [REM] and a mass% of Ti shown by [Ti]\nsatisfying [REM]\u0017[Ti]≥0.5.\nPatentansprüche\n1.Nichtorientiertes Elektrostahlblech mit ausgezeichnetem Ummagnetisierungsverlust, dadurch gekennzeichnet,\ndaß es in Masse-% enthält: höchstens 0,01 % C, 0,1 % bis 7,0 % Si, 0,1 % bis 3,0 % Al, 0,1 % bis 2,0 % Mn,\nhöchstens 0,005 % N, über 0,0015 % bis 0,02 % Ti, höchstens 0,05 % SEM, höchstens 0,005 % S, höchstens 0,005\n% O, optional höchstens 0,5 % P, höchstens 3,0 % Cu, höchstens 0,05 % Ca und Mg, höchstens 20 % Cr, höchstens\n5,0 % Ni, höchstens insgesamt 0,3 % Sn und/oder Sb, höchstens 0,01 % Zr, höchstens 0,01 % V und/oder höchstens\n0,005 % B sowie als Rest Eisen und unvermeidliche Verunreinigungen und es einen Masseprozentsatz von S,\nangegeben durch [S], einen Masseprozentsatz von O, angegeben durch [O], einen Masseprozentsatz von SEM,\nangegeben durch [SEM], einen Masseprozentsatz von Ti, angegeben durch [Ti], und einen Masseprozentsatz von\nN, angegeben durch [N], hat, die Formel (1) und Formel (2) erfüllen: \n\nEP 1 816 226 B1\n13\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nwobei das nichtorientierte Elektrostahlblech nach Fertigglühen und vor Spannungsfreiglühen SEM-Oxysulfide mit\nRissen oder Brüchen und mit einer Größe von 1 Pm bis 5 Pm enthält und der Anteil der Anzahl von SEM-Oxysulfiden\nin Bindung mit TiN in den SEM-Oxysulfiden mit Rissen oder Brüchen und mit einer Größe von 1 Pm bis 5 Pm\nmindestens 5 % beträgt.\n2.Nichtorientiertes Elektrostahlblech mit ausgezeichnetem Ummagnetisierungsverlust nach Anspruch 1, dadurch\ngekennzeichnet, daß es ferner in Masse-% 0,00075 % bis 0,05 % SEM enthält und einen Masseprozentsatz von\nSEM, angegeben durch [SEM], sowie einen Masseprozentsatz von Ti, angegeben durch [Ti], hat, die [SEM] \u0017 [Ti]\n≥ 0,5 erfüllen.\nRevendications\n1.Feuille en acier électrique non-orienté de perte dans le fer supérieure caractérisée en ce qu’elle contient, en %\nen masse, C : 0,01 % ou inférieur ;

Recently in particular, as a motor to be used for an electric vehicle or the like, a demand for a small-sized\nhigh-power motor is high. Such an electric vehicle motor is designed to make high-speed rotation possible to thereby\nobtain high torque.\n[0003]A high-speed rotation motor is also used for a machine tool and an electrical apparatus such as a vacuum\ncleaner. An outer size of a high-speed rotation motor for an electric vehicle is larger than that of a high-speed rotation\nmotor for an electrical apparatus. Further, as the high-speed rotation motor for an electric vehicle, a DC brushless motor\nis mainly used. In the DC brushless motor, magnets are embedded in the vicinity of an outer periphery of a rotor. In the\nabove structure, a width of a bridge portion in an outer periphery portion of the rotor (a width between magnets from the\nmost outer periphery of the rotor to a steel sheet) is extremely narrow, which is 1 to 2 mm, depending on a position.\nThus, a high-strength steel sheet has been required for the high-speed rotation motor for an electric vehicle rather than\na conventional non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0004]In Patent Document 1, there is disclosed a non-oriented electrical steel sheet in which Mn and Ni are added\nto Si to achieve solid solution strengthening. However, it is not possible to obtain sufficient strength even by the above\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheet. Further, due to the addition of Mn and Ni, its toughness is likely to be reduced, and\nsufficient productivity and a sufficient yield cannot be obtained. Further, prices of alloys to be added are high. In recent\nyears in particular, the price of Ni has suddenly risen due to a worldwide demand balance.\n[0005]In Patent Documents 2 and 3, there are disclosed non-oriented electrical steel sheets in which carbonitrides\nare dispersed in steel to achieve strengthening. However, it is not possible to obtain sufficient strength even by these\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheets.\n[0006]In Patent Document 4, there is disclosed a non-oriented electrical steel sheet in which a Cu precipitate is used\nto achieve strengthening. However, when manufacturing the above non-oriented electrical steel sheet, a thermal treat-\nment condition is restricted. Thus, strength and magnetic properties to be required cannot be obtained.\n[0007]\nPatent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. sho 62-256917\nPatent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 06-330255\nPatent Document 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 10-018005\nPatent Document 4: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2004-084053\nSummary of the Invention\n[0008]An object of the present invention is to provide a high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet capable of\neasily obtaining high strength and magnetic properties and a method of manufacturing the same.\n[0009]In the present invention, the following is set as the gist in order to solve the above-described problems.\n[0010](I) A high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet contains:\nby mass%,\nC: not less than 0.002% nor more than 0.05%;\nSi: not less than 2.0% nor more than 4.0%;\nMn: not less than 0.05% nor more than 1.0%;\nN: not less than 0.002% nor more than 0.05%;

As a\nresult, it has been found that a high annealing temperature making Cu once solid-dissolving is needed at finish-annealing\nafter cold rolling in order to strengthen a steel sheet by precipitation of Cu.\n[0019]However, it has also been learned that simply increasing the finish-annealing temperature coarsens crystal\ngrains, and strengthening margin by the Cu precipitation is reduced.\n[0020]Further, it has also been learned that when crystal grain coarsening and strengthening by the Cu precipitation\nare overlapped, fracture elongation at a tensile test is remarkably reduced. The above remarkable reduction in fracture\nelongation, in the case when a motor core is punched out from the steel sheet in particular, causes a crack in a punched-\nout end surface to thereby develop to a remarkable reduction in a yield and productivity of the motor core. Thus, it is\ndesirable to avoid the remarkable reduction in fracture elongation.\n\nEP 2 278 034 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0021]Thus, the present inventors have further advanced earnest researches on a method of solving these various\nproblems while enjoying strengthening by the Cu precipitation. As a result, it has been learned that some determined\namounts of C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V are contained, thereby enabling both strengthening by the Cu precipitation and making\ncrystal grains fine to be achieved and enabling the previously described various problems to be solved.\n[0022]Further, it has been learned that a magnetic property required for a rotor being the main use of a high-strength\nelectrical steel sheet is an eddy current loss (We) at a high frequency of 400 Hz or more, and as for a reduction in the\neddy current loss (We) as well, making crystal grains fine by containing C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V is effective.\n[0023]Here, experimental results that have led to the present invention will be explained.\n(Experiment 1)\n[0024]In a vacuum melting furnace in a laboratory, steels containing, by mass%, Si: 3.1%, Mn: 0.2%, Al: 0.5%, and\nCu: 2.0% with C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V by mass% shown in Table 1 were manufactured and heated at 1100 ̊C for 60\nminutes, and then the steels were hot rolled immediately, and hot-rolled sheets having sheet thicknesses of 2.0 mm\nwere obtained. Thereafter, these hot-rolled sheets were pickled, and by cold rolling once, cold-rolled sheets having\nsheet thicknesses of 0.35 mm were obtained. Finish-annealing at 800 ̊C to 1000 ̊C for 30 seconds was applied to these\ncold-rolled sheets.

In Material\nA hardly containing C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V, both the yield strength and the fracture elongation were low, and the eddy\ncurrent loss was high. This is because crystal grains were coarsened at finish-annealing at 900 ̊C and 1000 ̊C.\n[0028]As for Material B, a recrystallization area ratio at finish-annealing at 900 ̊C was low. This is inferred that Nb,\nwhich was a little contained, precipitated immediately before recrystallization during finish-annealing to delay recrystal-\nlization. Further, it is inferred that by finish-annealing at 1000 ̊C, Nb solid-dissolved to coarsen crystal grains, and thus\na result similar to that of Material A was exhibited.\n[0029]It is inferred that as for Material C in which good properties were obtained, a Nb precipitate was appropriately\ndispersed to precipitate, and as for Material D, a Ti precipitate was appropriately dispersed to precipitate to suppress\ncrystal grain growth at 900 ̊C and 1000 ̊C. On the other hand, Cu once solid-dissolved at finish-annealing temperatures\nof900 ̊Cand1000 ̊C,andfurtheratthetimeofcoolingduringfinish-annealing,Cuprecipitatedfinely,sothatstrengthening\nby the Cu precipitation could be optimized. As a result, it is inferred that the high yield strength and fracture elongation\nand the low eddy current loss could be obtained.\n[0030]As for Material E, the yield strength was high, but the fracture elongation was low. This can be considered that\nexcess C adversely affected Material E. Incidentally, under any one of the conditions as well, recrystallization did not\noccur at finish-annealing at 800 ̊C. This can be considered that Cu, which had solid-dissolved before annealing, precip-\nitated during annealing to delay recrystallization.\n(Experiment 2)\n[0031]In a vacuum melting furnace in a laboratory, steels containing, by mass%, Si: 2.8%, Mn: 0.1%, Al: 1.0%, and\nCu: 1.8% with C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V by mass% shown in Table 3 were manufactured and heated at 1150 ̊C for 60\nminutes, and then the steels were hot rolled immediately, and hot-rolled sheets having sheet thicknesses of 2.2 mm\nwere obtained.

This is because crystal grains were coarsened at finish-annealing at 900 ̊C and\n1000 ̊C.\n[0035]As for Material G, the recrystallization area ratio at finish-annealing at 900 ̊C was low. This is inferred that Nb,\nwhich was a little contained, precipitated immediately before recrystallization during finish-annealing to delay recrystal-\nlization.

This can be considered that\nexcess N adversely affected Material J. Incidentally, under any one of the conditions as well, recrystallization did not\noccur at finish-annealing at 800 ̊C. This can be considered that Cu, which had solid-dissolved before annealing precip-\nitated during annealing to delay recrystallization.\n[0038]Finish-annealing at 800 ̊C has been so far performed as a process of making crystal grains fine. That is, finish-\nannealing at 800 ̊C has been performed under a purpose in which by finish-annealing as above, Cu once solid-dissolves\nto achieve high-strengthening, and a steel sheet is recrystallized, and then crystal grains are not allowed to be coarsened.\nHowever, from Experiments 1 and 2, it has been found that even if the annealing temperature is adjusted while adding\nCu, only with the above, it is difficult to obtain sufficient strength. That is, in a conventional technique, it is difficult to\nachievebothmechanicalpropertiesandmagneticproperties.Ontheotherhand,thepresentinventionaswillbedescribed\nbelow makes it possible to achieve both mechanical properties and magnetic properties.\n[0039]Next, a reason for limiting a numerical value in a high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to\nthe present invention will be described. Hereinafter, % means mass%.\n[0040]C is an element necessary for making crystal grains fine. Fine carbide increases nucleation sites at the time\nof recrystallization and further has an effect of suppressing crystal grain growth. In order to enjoy the effect, a C content\nis 0.002% or more. When N is less than 0.005% in particular, the preferable C content is 0.01% or more, and more\npreferably 0.02% or more. On the other hand, when C is added over 0.05%, the fracture elongation is remarkably\nreduced. Thus, an upper limit of the C content is set to 0.05%.\n[0041]Si is effective for reducing the eddy current loss, and is an element effective for solid solution strengthening\nas well. However, when Si is added excessively, cold rolling performance is remarkably reduced. Thus, an upper limit\nof a Si content is set to 4.0%. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of solid solution strengthening and the eddy current\nloss, a lower limit is set to 2.0%.\n[0042]Mn, similarly to Si, reduces the eddy current loss, and is an element effective for increasing strength. However,\neven when a Mn content exceeds 1.0%, an effect does not improve to be saturated, and thus an upper limit of the Mn\ncontent is set to 1.0%. On the other hand, from the viewpoint of sulfide generation, a lower limit is set to 0.05%.\n[0043]Al, similarly to Si, is an element effective for increasing resistivity. However, when an Al content exceeds 3.0%,\ncastability is reduced, and thus considering productivity, an upper limit of the Al content is set to 3.0%. A lower limit is\nnot set in particular. However, from the viewpoint of stabilizing deoxidation (nozzle clogging prevention during casting),\nit is preferable that the Al content in the case of Al deoxidation is 0.02% or more, and the Al content in the case of Si\ndeoxidation is 0.01% or more.\n[0044]N is an element necessary for making crystal grains fine. Fine nitride increases nucleation sites at the time of\nrecrystallization, and further has an effect of suppressing crystal grain growth. In order to enjoy the effect, an N content\nis set to 0.002% or more. When N of 0.005% or more is contained greatly over a normal level, the effect of suppressing\ncrystal grain growth becomes further remarkable. The higher the N content is, the larger the above effect is, so that the\nN content is preferably further increased to 0.01% or more, and more preferably to 0.02% or more. In the case when\nthe C content is less than 0.005% in particular, the effect to be obtained by the N addition as above appears more\nstrongly. On the other hand, when N is added over 0.05%, the fracture elongation is remarkably reduced. Thus, an upper\nlimit of the N content is set to 0.05%.\n[0045]Cu is an important element of bringing precipitation strengthening. When a Cu content is less than 0.5%, Cu\ncompletely solid-dissolves in the steel and an effect of the precipitation strengthening cannot be obtained, so that a\nlower limit of the Cu content is set to 0.5%. An upper limit is set to 3.0% in consideration of the fact that strength is to\nbe saturated.\n[0046]Ni is an effective element that hardly embrittles the steel sheet to enable the steel sheet to be high-strengthened.\n\nEP 2 278 034 A1\n12\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nNi may be added depending on strength to be required because it is expensive. In the case when Ni is added, 0.5% or\nmore is preferably contained in order to sufficiently obtain an effect of Ni. Further, an upper limit is set to 3.0% in\nconsideration of its cost. Further, from the viewpoint of suppressing a scab to occur by the Cu addition, Ni of 1/2 or more\nof a Cu addition amount is preferably added.\n[0047]Sn improves texture and further has an effect of suppressing nitriding and oxidation at the time of annealing.\nParticularly, an effect of improving a magnetic flux density to be reduced by the Cu addition is large. When an Sn content\nis less than 0.01%, the desired effects cannot be obtained, and on the other hand, when Sn is added over 0.10%, there\nis sometimes a case that an increase in a scab is caused. Thus, an Sn addition amount is preferably not less than 0.01%\nnor more than 0.10%.\n[0048]B segregates in grain boundaries and has an effect of increasing toughnesses of a hot-rolled sheet and a hot-\nrolled-annealed sheet. When a B content is less than 0.0010%, the desired effect cannot be obtained, and on the other\nhand, when B is added over 0.0050%, there is sometimes a case that a slab crack at the time of casting occurs. Thus,\na B addition amount is preferably not less than 0.0010% nor more than 0.0050%.\n[0049]Four elements of Nb, Zr, Ti, and V generate carbide or nitride and have an effect of suppressing coarsening\nof a crystal grain diameter. Then, in the case when Formula (1) constituted by using values obtained after mass% of\neach of the elements is divided by an atomic weight is satisfied, the remarkable effect is exhibited. [Nb] represents a\nNb content (mass%), [Zr] represents a Zr content (mass%), [Ti] represents a Ti content (mass%), and [V] represents a\nV content (mass%).\n[0050]In Formula (1), in the case when a value on the right side is less than 2.0310\n-4\n, a precipitation amount becomes\ninsufficient, and the sufficient effect of suppressing crystal grains cannot be obtained. Thus, a lower limit of the value\non the right side is set to 2.0310\n-4\n. On the other hand, excess contents of these elements solid-dissolve in the steel\nand do not affect properties of the steel, so that an upper limit of the value on the right side is not defined in particular.\nHowever, in consideration of properties and costs, the value on the right side is preferably 1.0310\n-2\n or less.\n[0051]Formula (2), where a relationship of the six elements of C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V is defined, is an important\nparameter for making crystal grains fine in alliance with Formula (1). [C] represents the C content (mass%) and [N]\nrepresents the N content (mass%) .\n[0052]Formula (1) is merely such that a maximum amount capable of forming carbide or nitride is defined, and it is\nnot possible to sufficiently suppress crystal grain growth during final annealing only by the above condition.\n[0053]The second term in Formula (2) is such that the right side in Formula (1) is subtracted from the sum of a value\nobtained after mass% of C is divided by an atomic weight and a value obtained after mass% of N is divided by an atomic\nweight, and is a parameter representing the excess C amount and/or N amount that do/does not form carbonitride.\n[0054]Excess C and/or N as above are/is extremely important for making crystal grains fine. This is because in the\ncase when C and/or N are/is contained excessively, carbonitride is appropriately dispersed to precipitate before finish-\nannealing to thereby enable crystal grain growth at the time of annealing to be suppressed securely.\n[0055]In the present invention, carbide, nitride, and carbonitride have extremely important roles, and among them,\nnitride and carbonitride are effective, and particularly, nitride has a remarkable effect. That is, when carbide and nitride\nare compared, nitride is more effective for the effect of the present invention, and nitride rather exhibits the effect\ncontributing to the effect of the present invention by a reduced amount. Further, when carbide and nitride in the same\namount are compared, nitride rather can obtain a large favorable effect, and can suppress an unfavorable side effect.\nThe \"favorable effect\" to be described here means making crystal grains fine, high-strengthening, and stability at a high\ntemperature, and the \"unfavorable side effect\" means an increase in a core loss and a crack originating from a precipitate\n(embittlement in particular).\n[0056]A mechanism in which properties of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet change depending on types of the\nprecipitates as above is unclear, but it is possible to consider that this is because the properties of a non-oriented\n\nEP 2 278 034 A1\n13\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nelectrical steel sheet are affected by precipitate sizes, forms (anisotropy), consistency with a parent phase, precipitation\nplaces, and so on. Further, it is possible to consider that the precipitate sizes and so on are affected by difference in\nsolubility of the constituent elements, difference in crystal structures of the precipitates, difference in sizes of constituent\natoms, and so on.\n[0057]As described above, balances with not only the Nb, Zr, Ti, and V contents but also the C content and a thermal\nhistory in a manufacturing process are considered to set the N content appropriately, so that in the present invention,\nnitride is preferentially formed as compared with a conventional electrical steel sheet. As a result, crystal grain growth\nat a high temperature is suppressed, thereby enabling an increase in a core loss and embrittlement to be suppressed.\n[0058]Further, as for carbonitride, a composition thereof varies depending on forming processes, so that properties\nand effects of carbonitride do not become the same, but it is said that carbonitride exhibits a more favorable effect than\nthe precipitate composed of at least only carbide. Thus, a ratio of the N content to the C content is preferably high, and\n[N]/[C] is preferably three or more, and more preferably five or more. Incidentally, a composition of carbonitride is\nconsidered to change by effects such that, for example, carbide is set as initial formation, nitride is set as initial formation,\nstructure similar to that of carbide is held in a growth process, structure similar to that of nitride is held in a growth process\nand the like.\n[0059]In the case when the value (parameter value) of the second term in Formula (2) is less than 1.0310\n-3\n, thermal\nstability of carbonitride weakens. For example, when carbonitride precipitates immediately before recrystallization during\nfinish-annealing to delay recrystallization, and further an annealing temperature is increased, the precipitate solid-dis-\nsolves again and crystal grains are coarsened, resulting that it becomes difficult to form fine grains stably. On the other\nhand, when C and/or N become/becomes excessive to a level where the parameter value exceeds 3.0310\n-3\n, hardening\noccurs during cooling, and elongation and toughness of the steel sheet deteriorate.\n[0060]From the reasons as above, a lower limit of the parameter value in Formula (2) is set to 1.0310\n-3\n, and an upper\nlimit is set to 3.0310\n-3\n.\n[0061]In the case when a recrystallization area ratio of the high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet itself is\nless than 50%, product properties, particularly, the fracture elongation is remarkably reduced. Thus, the above recrys-\ntallization area ratio is set to 50% or more.\n[0062]The yield stress at a tensile test is set to 700 MPa or more in consideration of strength to be required for a rotor\nto rotate at a high speed. Note that the yield stress to be defined here is a lower yield point.\n[0063]The fracture elongation is set to 10% or more from the viewpoint of suppressing a crack in a punched-out end\nsurface of a motor core.\n[0064]The eddy current loss is a loss to occur after current flows through a steel sheet at excitation, and in the case\nwhen the above loss is large, the motor core easily generates heat to cause demagnetization of magnets. An eddy\ncurrent loss We\n100/400\nhas large dependence on a sheet thickness of the steel sheet, and thus a sheet thickness t (mm)\nis set as a parameter to set the eddy current loss We\n100/400\nto 703t\n2\nor less as shown in Formula (3) as a tolerance\nrange of the rotor heat generation.\n[0065]As a method of calculating the above eddy current loss, a dual frequency method is used. When, for example,\nat a maximum magnetic flux density Bmax of 1.0 T, a core loss at a frequency f\n1\nis set to W\n1\nand a core loss at a\nfrequency f\n2\nis set to W\n2\n, the eddy current loss We\n10/400\nof W\n10/400\ncan be calculated by \"(W\n2\n/f\n2\n-W\n1\n/f\n1\n)/(f\n2\n-f\n1\n)34003400\".\n[0066]As long as a plurality of core loss values at different frequencies exist at the maximum magnetic flux density\nBmax of 1.0 T, the calculation is possible to be performed, and thus a measurement frequency is not defined in particular.\nHowever, if possible, the calculation is preferably performed at a frequency close to 400 Hz, or in a frequency range of,\nfor example, 100 to 800 Hz or so. Note that the maximum magnetic flux density Bmax is a maximum magnetic flux\ndensity to be excited when measuring a core loss.\n[0067]Next, a reason for limiting a numerical value in a method of manufacturing the high-strength non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet according to the present invention will be described.\n[0068]At finish-annealing, Cu once solid-dissolves and precipitates during cooling, and thereby high strength can be\nobtained. Thus, a soaking temperature T ( ̊C) of finish-annealing has to be a solid solution temperature of Cu or more.\nThesolidsolutiontemperaturedependsontheCucontent.WhentheCucontentissetto\"a\"(mass%),whenatemperature\n( ̊C) is 2003a + 500 or more, Cu completely solid-dissolves, so that the soaking temperature T ( ̊C) of finish-annealing\nis set to 2003a + 500 or more as shown in Formula (4).\n\nEP 2 278 034 A1\n14\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0069]Whenacoilingtemperatureatthetimeofhotrollingexceeds550 ̊C,carbonitrideandaCuprecipitate,depending\non a hot-rolled sheet, remarkably reduce its toughness. Thus, the coiling temperature at the time of hot rolling is set to\n550 ̊C or less. With regard to the toughness of a hot-rolled sheet, a ductile/brittle fracture transition temperature at a\nCharpy impact test is set to 70 ̊C or less from the viewpoint of fracture suppression at the time of cold rolling.\n[0070]With regard to annealing of the hot-rolled sheet, when a cooling rate from 900 ̊C to 500 ̊C is lower than 50 ̊C/sec,\ntoughness of a hot-rolled-annealed sheet is remarkably reduced by carbonitride and the Cu precipitate. Thus, the cooling\nrate in the above temperature range is set to 50 ̊C/sec or more. With regard to the toughness of the steel sheet after\nannealing, the ductile/brittle fracture transition temperature at the Charpy impact test is set to 70 ̊C or less from the\nviewpoint of fracture suppression at the time of cold rolling.\n[0071]Incidentally, an annealing temperature of the hot-rolled sheet is not defined in particular, but the purpose of\nannealing of the hot-rolled sheet is recrystallization and grain growth promotion of the hot-rolled sheet, and thus the\nannealingtemperatureispreferably900 ̊Cormore,andontheotherhand,fromtheviewpointofbrittleness,itispreferably\n1100 ̊C or less.\n[0072]The transition temperature defined here is a temperature such that as defined in Japan Industrial Standard\n(JIS), in a transition curve showing a relationship between a test temperature and a ductile fracture rate, the ductile\nfracture rate is 50%. A temperature corresponding an average value of absorbed energy at the ductile fracture rate of\n0% and absorbed energy at the ductile fracture rate of 100% may also be employed.\n[0073]A length and height of a test piece to be used for the Charpy impact test are set to sizes defined in JIS. On the\nother hand, a width of the test piece is set to a thickness of the hot-rolled sheet. Thus, the size, in a rolling direction, is\n55 mm in length and 10 mm in height, and the width is 1.5 mm to 3.0 mm or so depending on the thickness of the hot-\nrolled sheet. Further, when performing the test, it is rather preferable that the plural test pieces are stacked to approximate\na thickness of 10 mm that is a regular test condition.\n(Embodiment 1)\n[0074]In a vacuum melting furnace, steels containing, by mass%, Si: 2.9%, Mn: 0.2%, Al: 0.7%, and Cu: 1.5%, in\nwhich C, N, Nb, Zr, Ti, and V differ in mass%, were manufactured and heated at 1150 ̊C for 60 minutes, and then the\nsteels were hot rolled immediately, and hot-rolled sheets having sheet thicknesses of 2.3 mm were obtained. Thereafter,\nthese hot-rolled sheets were pickled, and by cold rolling once, cold-rolled sheets having sheet thicknesses of 0.5 mm\nwere obtained. Finish-annealing at 900 ̊C for 60 seconds was applied to these cold-rolled sheets.

In the electrical steel sheet as above, by mainly improving purity and coarsening crystal grains, a\nmagnetizing property in a low magnetic field of about 1.0 T or less has been improved.\n[0003]Further, in recent years, higher performance properties have been required for a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet to be used as an iron core material of a rotor due to a worldwide increase in achievement of energy saving of an\nelectrical apparatus.\n[0004]However, it is difficult to further improve purity of an electrical steel sheet industrially. Further, a reduction in a\ncore loss by coarsening crystal grains is saturated when a crystal grain diameter is 150 Pm or so, but a crystal grain\ndiameter of a conventional electrical steel sheet has already reached 150 Pm or so. Thus, even though crystal grains\nare further coarsened, it is difficult to further reduce a core loss.\n[0005]As described above, it has been difficult to further improve a magnetic property in a low magnetic field in a\nconventional art.\nCITATION LIST\nPATENT LITERATURE\n[0006]\nPatent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 07-070719\nPatent Document 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 08-165520\nPatent Document 3: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 08-283853\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nTECHNICAL PROBLEM\n[0007]The present invention has an object to provide a non-oriented electrical steel sheet in which a magnetic property\nin a low magnetic field is allowed to be further improved and a method of manufacturing the same.\nSOLUTION TO PROBLEM\n[0008]The present invention has been made in order to solve problems described above, and the gist thereof is as\nfollows.\n[0009]\n(1) A non-oriented electrical steel sheet includes: a base material; and an Fe-Ni alloy film formed on at least one\nsurface of the base material, containing, by mass%, Fe: 10% to 40% and Ni: 60% to 90%, and having a thickness\nof 0.1 Pm or more.\n(2) The non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in (1), wherein the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film is equal to\nor less than 0.6 Pm.\n(3) The non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in (1) or (2), in which the base material contains, by mass%:\nC: 0.05% or less; Si: not less than 0.1% nor more than 7.0%; and Al: not less than 0.01% nor more than 7.0%, and\na balance of the base material is composed of Fe and inevitable impurities.\n(4) The non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in any one of (1) to (3), further includes an insulating film formed\non a surface of the base material.\n[0010]\n\nEP 2 316 980 A1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n(5) A method of manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet includes: forming, on at least one surface of a\nbase material, an Fe-Ni alloy film that contains, by mass%, Fe: 10% to 40% and Ni: 60% to 90% to have a thickness\nof 0.1 Pm or more.\n(6) The method of manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in (5), in which the thickness of\nthe Fe-Ni alloy film is equal to or less than 0.6 Pm.\n(7) The method of manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in (5) or (6), in which the base\nmaterial contains, by mass%: C: 0.05% or less; Si: not less than 0.1% nor more than 7.0%; and Al: not less than\n0.01% nor more than 7.0%, and a balance of the base material is composed of Fe and inevitable impurities.\n(8) The method of manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet described in any one of (5) to (7), further\nincludes forming an insulating film on a surface of the base material, before the forming the Fe-Ni alloy film.\n(9) The method of manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet described tin any one of (5) to (7), further\nincludes forming an insulating film on a surface of the base material, after the forming the Fe-Ni alloy film.\nADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION\n[0011]According to the present invention, by a function of an appropriate Fe-Ni alloy film, magnetic domains on a\nsurface of a base material are appropriately controlled, so that a magnetic property can be improved.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n[0012]\n[Fig. 1] Fig. 1 is a view showing magnetic properties in case of a low magnetic field;\n[Fig. 2] Fig. 2 is a view showing a relationship between a frequency and a core loss improvement rate;\n[Fig. 3] Fig. 3 is a view showing a relationship between a Ni content and a relative permeability;\n[Fig. 4] Fig. 4 is a view showing relationships between a thickness of an Fe-Ni ally film and the relative permeability;\n[Fig. 5] Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing a structure of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to an\nembodiment of the present invention;\n[Fig. 6] Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing a structure of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to\nanother embodiment of the present invention; and\n[Fig. 7] Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view showing a structure of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to still\nanother embodiment of the present invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0013]The present inventors found that, when an Fe-Ni alloy film is coated on a base material of a non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, magnetic domains in the vicinity of a surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet are aligned\nin a direction parallel to the surface thereof, though details will be described later. Further, as a result, the present\ninventors also found that a magnetizing property in a low magnetic field (that is, for example, 0.8 T or so) is improved.\nThe improvement in the magnetizing property in the low magnetic field can contribute to achievement of energy saving\nof an electrical apparatus, for example. Note that in the following explanation, a unit of a content of an element is mass%\nor mass ppm.\n[0014]The present inventors formed an Fe-78%Ni alloy film on one surface of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet\n(base material) by a sputtering method. That is, one surface of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet was coated with an\nFe-78 Ni alloy film. As the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.002%, Si: 3.0%, and Al: 0.5%, a\nbalance of which being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of 0.35 mm was used. Further,\na thickness of the Fe-78%Ni alloy film was set to 0.4 Pm. Then, a DC magnetizing property was measured. When\nmeasuring the DC magnetizing property, a relationship between a maximum magnetic flux density Bm (0.4 T to 1.6 T)\nand a relative permeability Ps was obtained. At this time, the relative permeability Ps was measured in a rolling direction.\nFor comparison, similar measurement was also conducted in a non-oriented electrical steel sheet having no Fe-78%Ni\nalloy film formed thereon. Results thereof are shown in Fig. 1.\n[0015]As shown in Fig. 1, in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet having the Fe-78%Ni alloy film formed thereon,\nthe relative permeability Ps in a low magnetic, field was increased as compared with the one having no Fe-78%Ni alloy\nfilm formed thereon. That is, a magnetic property in a low magnetic field was improved. Particularly, in the case of the\nmaximum magnetic flux density Bm being 0.8T or so, the relative permeability Ps was maximum. Incidentally, the relative\npermeability in the case of the maximum magnetic flux density Bm being 0.8T is a relative permeability to be obtained\nfrom a DC magnetization curve in which the maximum magnetic flux density is 0.8 T.\n[0016]The present inventors obtained a relationship between a frequency (20 Hz to 400 Hz) and a core loss W\n1\n in\n\nEP 2 316 980 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nthe case of the maximum magnetic flux density Bm being 1.5 T in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet having the Fe-\n78%Ni alloy film formed thereon. Further, in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet having no Fe-78 Ni alloy film formed\nthereon, they obtained a relationship between a frequency (20 Hz to 400 Hz) and a core loss W\n2\n in the case of the\nmaximum magnetic flux density Bm being 1.5 T. Then, these relationships were compared.\n[0017]As a result, at frequencies of 400 Hz or less, the core loss W\n1\n was lower than the core loss W\n2\n. Fig. 2 shows\na relationship between a frequency and a core loss improvement rate. The core loss improvement rate is expressed by\nthe following expression.\ncore loss improvement rate (%) = 100 \u0016 (1 - W\n1\n/W\n2\n)\n[0018]As shown in Fig. 2, at frequencies of 400 Hz or less, the core loss improvement rate was 15% or more.\n[0019]When the results shown in Fig. 1 and a result shown in Fig. 2 are considered, it can be said that the formation\nof the Fe-78%Ni alloy film leads to the improvement of the relative permeability Ps and the reduction of the core loss (a\nhysteresis loss). The core loss at the maximum magnetic flux density of 1.5 T and at a frequency of 50 Hz is described\nas W15/50.\n[0020]The present inventors formed Fe-Ni alloy films having various compositions (Ni: 0% to 100%) on one surface\nof a non-oriented electrical steel sheet by an electroplating method in order to find the composition of the Fe-Ni alloy\nfilm suitable for improving a magnetic property. That is, one surface of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet was coated\nwith Fe-Ni alloy films having different compositions. As the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.003%,\nSi: 2.1%, and Al: 0.3%, a balance of which being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of\n0.35 mm was used. Further, thicknesses of the Fe-Ni alloy films were set to 0.3 Pm in any of the compositions. Then,\na DC magnetizing property was measured. When measuring the DC magnetizing property, the maximum magnetic flux\ndensity Bm was set to 0.8 T, and a relationship between a Ni content and the relative permeability Ps was obtained. A\nresult thereof is shown in Fig. 3.\n[0021]As shown in Fig. 3, in the case of the Ni content being 78.5% or so, the relative permeability Ps was maximum.\nGenerally, the composition of Fe-78.5%Ni is a permalloy composition having a high magnetic permeability. On the other\nhand, in the case of the Ni content being less than 60%, in the case of it being less than 50% in particular, the relative\npermeability Ps was low. Further, the relative permeability Ps was low also in the case when the Ni content exceeded\n90%. It is possible to consider that such a tendency occurs because the composition in which the Ni content is less than\n60% or the composition in which it exceeds 90% has a large difference in the permalloy composition.\n[0022]The present inventors formed Fe-Ni alloy films having various thicknesses (0.05 Pm to 0.8Pm) on one surface\nof a non-oriented electrical steel sheet by an immersion plating method in order to find the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy\nfilm suitable for improving a magnetic property. That is, one surface of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet was coated\nwith Fe-Ni alloy films having different thicknesses. As the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.003%,\nSi: 2.4%, and Al: 0.5%, a balance of which being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of\n0.35 mm was used. Further, the Ni contents of the Fe-Ni alloy films were set to 78% in any of the thicknesses. Then, a\nDC magnetizing property was measured. When measuring the DC magnetizing property, the maximum magnetic flux\ndensity Bm was set to 0.8 T, and a relationship between the thickness (a coating thickness) of the Fe-Ni alloy film and\nthe relative permeability Ps was obtained. Further, similar measurement was also conducted in one having the Fe-Ni\nalloy films formed on both surfaces of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Results thereof are shown in Fig. 4.\n[0023]As shown in Fig. 4, when the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film was less than 0.1 Pm, the relative permeability\nPs was extremely low. Further, when the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film exceeded 0.6 Pm, an effect of improving the\nrelative permeability Ps was saturated.\n[0024]The reason why the relative permeability Ps is extremely low when the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film is less\nthan 0.1 Pm is that magnetic domains on a surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet are not easily aligned despite\nforming the Fe-Ni alloy film. Further, the reason why the effect of improving the relative permeability Ps is saturated is\nthat as long as the magnetic domains on the surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet are sufficiently aligned,\neven though the Fe-Ni alloy film having the thickness of the above or more is formed, the magnetic domains are not\neasily aligned any more.\n[0025]Further, as shown in Fig. 4, the relative permeability Ps in the case when the Fe-Ni alloy film was formed on\none surface and the relative permeability Ps in the case when the Fe-Ni alloy film was formed on both surfaces were\nequal to each other.\n[0026]This is because when excitation, a magnetic flux concentrates in a region to be most easily magnetized in a\nthickness direction of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. That is, the reason is that although the Fe-Ni alloy film is\nformed on a single region, (one surface) in the thickness direction, or the Fe-Ni alloy films are formed on two regions\n(both surfaces) in the thickness direction, it is in a single region that the magnetic flux concentrates most.\n[0027]The present inventors learned from these results of experiments that by forming the Fe-Ni alloy film on a surface\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, the relative permeability and the core loss are dramatically improved. Further,\nthe present inventors also learned that it is necessary that the Ni content of the Fe-Ni alloy film is 60% to 90% aid the\nthickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film is 0.1 Pm or more for improving the relative permeability and the core loss. Further, the\n\nEP 2 316 980 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\npresent inventors also learned that when the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film exceeds 0.6 Pm, the effect of improving\nthe relative permeability and the core loss is saturated, and even though the Fe-Ni alloy film is formed on one surface\nor it is formed on both surfaces, the effect of improving the relative permeability and the core loss is equal to each other\nin both the cases.\n[0028]Next, the details of the present invention that has been made based on these new findings will be explained.\nFirst, there will be explained a composition of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet itself (base material), on a surface of\nwhich an Fe-Ni alloy film is to be formed.\n[0029]When a C content exceeds 0.05%, a core loss is easily increased remarkably. Thus, the C content is preferably\n0.05% or less.\n[0030]Si is an element effective to increase electrical resistance, and when a Si content is less than 0.1%, it becomes\ndifficult to obtain sufficient resistivity. On the other hand, when the Si content ratio of exceeds 7%, cold-rolling performance\nis easily lowered remarkably. Thus, the Si content is preferably not less than 0.1% nor more than 7%.\n[0031]Al is an element effective to increase electrical resistance similarly to Si. Further, Al is an element also con-\ntributing to deoxidation, and when an Al content is less than 0.01%, it is difficult to perform sufficient deoxidation. On\nthe other hand, when the Al content exceeds 7%, castability is lowered, and productivity is easily lowered. Thus, the Al\ncontent is preferably not less than 0.01% nor more than 7%.\n[0032]Further, other components of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet (base material) are not limited in particular,\nbut contents of Mn, Ti, N, S, Sn, Cu, and Ni preferably fall within the following ranges.\n[0033]Mn generates MnS, and has an effect of rendering S being an impurity harmless. Thus, Mn is preferably\ncontained 0.1% or more. However, even though Mn is contained more than 1.0%, the effect of rendering S harmless\nbecomes saturated.\n[0034]Ti generates nitride and/or carbide to deteriorate a magnetizing property and a core loss. Thus, the Ti content\nis preferably 30 ppm or less, and more preferably 15 ppm or less.\n[0035]N generates AlN and/or TiN to deteriorate a magnetizing property. Thus, the N content is preferably 0.0030%\nor less.\n[0036]S generates MnS to deteriorate a magnetizing property and a core loss. Thus, the S content is preferably 30\nppm or less.\n[0037]Sn, Cu, and Ni have a function of inhibiting nitridation and oxidation of a surface of a non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet during annealing, which is strain relief annealing in particular, and have a function of improving an excitation\nproperty by an improvement in aggregate structure. Thus, Sn, Cu, and Ni are preferably contained 0.01% or more in\ntotal. These effects are equal among Sn, Cu, and Ni, so that at least one type of them is only sufficient to be contained.\nHowever, even though Sn, Cu, and Ni are contained more than 0.50% in total, the function of inhibiting nitridation and\noxidation by atmosphere gas during annealing and the function of improving aggregate structure is saturated.\n[0038]Next, the Fe-Ni alloy film will be explained.\n[0039]The Fe-Ni alloy film is preferably composed of Fe: 10% to 40% and Ni: 90% to 60%, and more preferably\ncomposed of Fe: 15% to 30% and Ni: 85% to 70%. This is to obtain a good magnetic property in a low magnetic field.\nIncidentally, other metallic elements such as Mo may also be contained in the Fe-Ni alloy film. In the above case, the\nFe-Ni alloy film preferably contains Fe: 10% to 40% and Ni: 90 to 60%, and more preferably contains Fe: 15% to 30%\nand Ni: 85% to 70%.\n[0040]A method of forming the Fe-Ni alloy film on a surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet (base material)\nis not limited in particular. It is possible to form the Fe-Ni alloy film on a surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet\nby, for example, a dry coating method such as a PVD (physical vapor deposition) method and a CVD (chemical vapor\ndeposition) method, and a wet coating method such as a plating method.\n[0041]The thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy films is set to 0.1 Pm or more. This is because the sufficient effects cannot be\nobtained when the thickness is less than 0.1 Pm as described above. On the other hand, when the thickness of the Fe-\nNi alloy film exceeds 0.6 Pm, the effect of improving the relative permeability and the core loss is saturated, so that the\nthickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film is sufficiently 0.6 Pm or less. However, the thickness may also exceed 0.6 Pm for a\nreason such as operation stability.\n[0042]Further, as described above, the Fe-Ni alloy film is sufficiently formed on one surface of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet (base material), but it may also be formed on both surfaces of the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet (base material).\n[0043]Next, there will be explained a magnetic property of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet having the Fe-Ni\nalloy film formed on at least one surface thereof.\n[0044]As for the DC magnetizing property of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet having the Fe-Ni alloy film formed\non one surface thereof, in the above-described experiments, the relative permeability Ps in the rolling direction exhibited\na maximum value at the maximum magnetic flux density Bm of 0.8 T or so, and the value was 10000 or more. Thus, it\nis possible to consider that as long as minimum various conditions as above are satisfied, the relative permeability Ps\nof 10000 or more can be obtained at the maximum magnetic flux density Bm of 0.8 T.\n\nEP 2 316 980 A1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0045]Further, in the above-described experiments, at frequencies of 400 Hz or less, by forming the Fe-Ni alloy film,\nthe core loss was improved by 15% or more. Thus, it is possible to consider that as long as the above-described minimum\nvarious conditions are satisfied, in any direction, by forming the Fe-Ni alloy film, the core loss is improved by 10% or more.\n[0046]Incidentally, a method of manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet as the base material, namely\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet before the Fe-Ni alloy film is formed thereon, is not limited in particular, and the\nnon-   oriented electrical steel sheet can be manufactured according to a conventional method. For example, annealing\nafter hot rolling may also be performed as needed. Further, a thickness of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet after\ncold rolling may also be set to 0.10 mm to 0.80 mm depending on a required property. Further, a finish annealing\ntemperature may also be adjusted within a range of 700°C to 1100°C depending on a required property. Further, strain\nrelief annealing may also be performed after a punching-out process of a motor core or the like.\n[0047]Further, when manufacturing the non-oriented electrical steel sheet as the base material, an insulating film is\nformed on a surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet after finish annealing, and the Fe-Ni alloy film may also\nbe formed after the above insulating film is formed. Further, the Fe-Ni alloy film may also be formed before the above\ninsulating film is formed.\n[0048]The non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to an embodiment of the present invention is provided with\na structure shown in Fig. 5, for example. That is, on one surface or both surfaces of a base material 1, an Fe-Ni alloy\nfilm 2 is formed. As shown in Fig. 6, an insulating film 3 may also be formed between the base material 1 and the Fe-\nNi alloy film 2, and as shown in Fig. 7, the insulating film 3 may also be formed on the Fe-Ni alloy film 2.\n[0049]Next, there will be explained experiments for confirming the effects of the present invention conducted by the\npresent inventors.\n<Experiment 1>\n[0050]Each of Fe-Ni alloy films having compositions shown in Table 1 was formed on one surface or both surfaces\nof a non-oriented electrical steel sheet (base materials), which was after finish annealing and before an insulating film\nwas formed thereof, by an electroplating method. That is, one surface or both surfaces of a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet was/were coated with Fe-Ni alloy film(s). As the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.002%, Si:\n3.2%, and Al: 1.0%, a balance of which being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of 0.35\nmm was used. Further, thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film was set to 0.5 Pm per one surface. Next, an insulating film was\nformed on an entire surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Then, the relative permeability Ps in the rolling\ndirection at the maximum magnetic flux density Bm of 0.8 T was measured. A result thereof is shown in Table 1.\n[0051]\n[0052]As shown in Table 1, in samples in which the Ni content of the Fe-Ni allow film were 60% to 90%, the high\nrelative permeability Ps of 10000 or more was obtained. On the other hand, in a sample in which the Ni content was\nless than 60% and a sample in which the Ni content exceeded 90%, the relative permeability Ps was lowered to less\nthan 10000. These tendencies were common between the samples in which the Fe-Ni alloy film was formed on only\none surface and the samples in which the Fe-Ni alloy films were formed on both surfaces.\n[Table 1]\nSample number  Fe (mass%)   Ni (mass%)  Coated surface   Relative permeabilityNote\n1-14852\none surface8400Comparative example\nboth surfaces8450Comparative example\n1-23961\none surface10100invention example\nboth surfaces10200Invention example\n1-31981\none surface12000Invention example\nboth surfaces11800Invention example\n1-41189\none surface10200Invention example\nboth surfaces10100Invention example\n1-5793\none surface8800Comparative example\nboth surfaces8900Comparative example\n\nEP 2 316 980 A1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n<Experiment 2>\n[0053]Each of Fe-78%Ni alloy films having thicknesses shown in Table 2 was formed on one surface of a non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet (base materials), which was after finish annealing and before an insulating film was formed thereon,\nby a PVD method. That is, Fe-78%Ni alloy film was coated on one surface of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet. As\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.001%, Si: 4.5%, and Al: 3.5%, a balance of which being\ncomposed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of 0.30 mm was used. Next, an insulating film was\nformed on an entire surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Then, the relative permeability Ps in the rolling\ndirection at the maximum magnetic flux density Bm of 0.8 T was measured. A result thereof is shown in Table 2.\n[0054]\n[0055]As shown in Table 2, in samples in which the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy film was 0.1 Pm or more, the high\nrelative permeability Ps of 10000 or more was obtained. Further, in samples in which the thickness of the Fe-Ni alloy\nfilm was less than 0.1 Pm, the relative permeability Ps was lowered to less than 10000. Further, when the thickness of\nthe Fe-Ni alloy film exceeded 0.6 Pm, the effects was saturated.\n<Experiment 3>\n[0056]Each of Fe-Ni alloy films having compositions shown in Table 3 was formed on one surface of a non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet (base material), which was after finish annealing and before an insulating film was formed thereon,\nby an immersion plating method. That is, an Fe-Ni alloy films was coated on one surface of a non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet. As the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, one containing C: 0.01%, Si: 2.5%, and Al : 4.5%, a balance of\nwhich being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, and having a thickness of 0.50 mm was used. Further, thickness\nof the Fe-Ni alloy film was set to 0.4 Pm. Next, an insulating film was formed on an entire surface of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet. Then, the relative permeability Ps in the rolling direction at the maximum magnetic flux density\nBm of 0.8 T was measured. Further, a core loss W15/50, (which is a core loss at the maximum magnetic flux density\nBm of 1.5 T and at a frequency of 50 Hz), was also measured.

In general,\ncentrifugal force acting on the rotor is in proportion to a rotation radius, and is in proportion to the square of a rotation\nspeed. For the above reason, extremely large stress acts on the rotor of the high-speed rotary machine. Thus, tensile\nstrength of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet for a rotor is preferably high. That is, the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet for a rotor preferably has high tension. As described above, high tensile strength (high tension) is required for the\nnon-   oriented electrical steel sheet for a rotor.\n[0003]On the other hand, in a non-oriented electrical steel sheet used for not only a rotor of a rotary machine but also\nan iron core, it is important that its core loss is low. Particularly, in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet for a rotor of a\nhigh-speed rotary machine, it is important that its high-frequency core loss is low. As described above, a low high-\nfrequency core loss is also required for the non-oriented electrical steel sheet for a rotor. That is, high efficiency when\nthe rotary machine is used at a high frequency is also required.\n[0004]However, the high tension and the low high-frequency core loss are in a relationship such that they are contrary\nto each other physically, and it is extremely difficult to achieve both of them.\n[0005]There has been proposed a technique in which the achievement of these is considered, but there has been\nno technique capable of easily manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet so far. For example, there has been\nproposed a technique in which a hot-rolled steel sheet having a high Si content is obtained and thereafter various types\nof temperature controls are performed, but cold rolling is extremely difficult to be performed because the Si content is\nhigh. Further, various types of temperature controls are performed in order to enable cold rolling to be performed, but\nthe above temperature controls are extremely peculiar, resulting that time, labor, and cost required for the above are\nincreased.\nCITATION LIST\nPATENT LITERATURE\n[0006]\nPatent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho 60-238421\nPatent Document 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho 61-9520\nPatent Document 3: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Sho 62-256917\nPatent Document 4: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Hei 2-8346\nPatent Document 5: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-186791\nPatent Document 6: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-186790\nPatent Document 7: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2008-240104\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nTECHNICAL PROBLEM\n[0007]The present invention has an object to provide a non-oriented electrical steel sheet capable of being manufac-\ntured easily and obtaining high tensile strength and a low high-frequency core loss.\nSOLUTION TO PROBLEM\n[0008]The present inventors have conducted earnest studies on a non-oriented electrical steel sheet from the viewpoint\nof obtaining favorable mechanical properties while suppressing a core loss low by solid solution strengthening, precip-\nitation strengthening, work strengthening, grain refining strengthening, strengthening by transformation composition,\nand so on. Further, the present inventors have repeated researches and analyses with regard to what index a high-\nfrequency core loss to be important in an actual high-speed rotary machine becomes, in other words, with regard to at\n\nEP 2 390 376 A1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nwhat frequency a core loss is important to be reduced. Further, greater importance is also given to easiness of processes\nsuch as cold rolling in a manufacturing process and avoidance of process complication.\n[0009]As a result, details will be described later, but it has been found that contents of Si, Mn, Ni, and so on are set\nappropriately and a ratio of a content of Ti to a total content of C and N is set appropriately, thereby enabling a high-\nfrequency core loss to be suppressed low while obtaining high tensile strength of, for example, 900 MPa or more. Further,\nas the high-frequency core loss, it has also been found that it is important that a core loss W\n10/1000\n, which is a core loss\nin the case of a magnetic flux density being 1.0 T and an excitation frequency being 1000 Hz, is low. Then, the present\ninventors have reached the following non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0010]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention contains: C: not less than 0.003 mass%\nnor more than 0.05 mass%; N: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%; and Si: not less than 2.8 mass%\nnor more than 3.5 mass%. The non-oriented electrical steel sheet further contains at least one kind selected from a\ngroup consisting of Ni: 4.0 mass% or less and Mn: 2.0 mass% or less, in a total amount of 0.5 mass% or more, and\nfurther contains Ti, a value R\nTi\n being not less than 1 nor more than 10, the value R\nTi\n being expressed by [Ti]/(4x([C]+\n[N])) when a Ti content is expressed as [Ti] mass%, a C content is expressed as [C] mass%, and an N content is\nexpressed as [N] mass%. An Al content is 3.0 mass% or less, a P content is 0.2 mass% or less, and a balance is\ncomposed of Fe and inevitable impurities.\nADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION\n[0011]According to the present invention, contents of Si, Mn, Ni, and so on and a value R\nTi\n are appropriate, and thus\nhigh tensile strength and a low high-frequency core loss can be obtained. Further, the contents of Si and so on are\nappropriate, and thus processes in a manufacturing process are easy to be performed, and addition of complex processes\nbased on embrittlement and the like can also be avoided.\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0012]Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in detail. First, components of a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet according to the present invention will be explained.\n[0013]Si has an effect of reducing a core loss such as a high-frequency core loss by increasing electrical resistance\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to thereby reduce an eddy current loss. Further, Si has an effect of increasing\ntension of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet by solid solution strengthening. When a Si content is less than 2.8\nmass%, these effects is insufficient. On the other hand, when the Si content exceeds 3.5 mass%, a reduction in a\nmagnetic flux density, embrittlement, difficulty in performing processes of cold rolling and the like, and an increase in a\nmaterial cost are caused. Thus, the Si content is set to not less than 2.8 mass% nor more than 3.5 mass%.\n[0014]Al, similarly to Si, has an effect of reducing a core loss such as a high-frequency core loss by increasing the\nelectrical resistance of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to thereby reduce an eddy current loss. Thus, Al may also\nbe contained as an aim to further reduce a high-frequency core loss. However, when an Al content exceeds 3.0 mass%,\na reduction in a magnetic flux density, embrittlement, difficulty in performing processes of cold rolling and the like, and\nan increase in a material cost are caused. Thus, an upper limit of the Al content is set to 3.0 mass%. Further, when the\nAl content is less than 0.1 mass%, fine precipitation of A1N is remarkably exhibited to increase a core loss, and thus\nthe Al content is preferably 0.1 mass% or more.\n[0015]Ni and Mn contribute to an improvement in tension of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. That is, Ni has\nan effect of increasing the tension by solid solution strengthening, and Mn has an effect of increasing the tension by\nsolid solution strengthening and grain refining strengthening. Further, Ni also has an effect of reducing a core loss such\nas a high-frequency core loss by increasing the electrical resistance of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to thereby\nreduce an eddy current loss. Further, Ni also contributes to an improvement in a magnetic flux density in accordance\nwith an increase in a saturated magnetic moment of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Mn has an effect of reducing\na core loss such as a high-frequency core loss by increasing the electrical resistance of the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet to thereby reduce an eddy current loss. When a total amount of a Ni content and a Mn content is less than 0.5\nmass%, these effects are insufficient, resulting that tensile strength of 900 MPa or more cannot be obtained. On the\nother hand, when the Ni content exceeds 4.0 mass%, a reduction in a magnetic flux density ascribable to the reduction\nin a saturated magnetic moment occurs. Further, when the Mn content exceeds 2.0 mass%, a magnetic flux density is\nreduced and further a material cost is increased. Thus, it is set in a manner that Ni of 4.0 mass% or less and/or Mn of\n2.0 mass% or less are/is contained in a total amount of 0.5 mass% or more.\n[0016]P has an effect of greatly increasing the tension of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Thus, P may also\nbe contained as an aim to further improve the tension. In order to achieve the above effect, 0.001 mass% or more of P\nis preferably contained. However, when P content exceeds 0.2 mass%, P segregates in crystal grain boundaries in a\nmanufacturing process to embrittle a hot-rolled steel sheet, resulting that cold rolling thereafter becomes extremely\n\nEP 2 390 376 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\ndifficult to be performed. Thus, an upper limit of the P content is set to 0.2 mass%.\n[0017]Ti has an effect of reacting with C and N to form a fine precipitate containing Ti carbonitride and increasing the\ntension of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet by precipitation strengthening and grain refining strengthening. Further,\n’ Ti being solid-dissolved in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet has an effect of orienting crystal orientations of a\nsurface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet in {111} when cold rolling, finish annealing, and the like, and increasing\nthe tension of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. In order to exhibit these effects sufficiently, it is important that\nappropriate amounts of both Ti to be precipitated as Ti carbonitride and Ti being solid-dissolved in the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet are contained.\n[0018]When a Ti content is expressed as [Ti] mass%, a C content is expressed as [C] mass%, and an N content is\nexpressed as [N] mass%, if a value R\nTi\n expressed by [Ti]/(4x([C]+[N])) is less than 1, the above-described effects cannot\nbe exhibited sufficiently. Thus, the value R\nTi\n is set to 1 or more. In the case of the value R\nTi\n being 1, all Ti is bonded to\nC and/or N theoretically, but practically, part of Ti is not bonded to either C or N to be contained in the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet as solid solution Ti. Note that the value R\nTi\n is preferably 2 or more, and more preferably 3 or more.\n[0019]On the other hand, when the value R\nTi\n exceeds 10, recrystallization is unlikely to occur and further embrittlement\nis likely to occur. Further, there is sometimes a case that in accordance with an increase in the solid solution Ti, the\norientation to {111} is too intensified to increase a core loss. Thus, the value R\nTi\n is set to 10 or less. Incidentally, the\nvalue R\nTi\n is preferably 9 or less, and more preferably 7 or less.\n[0020]Further, in order to make the value R\nTi\n fall within a range as above, it is set in a manner that the C content is\nnot less than 0.003 mass% nor more than 0.05 mass% and the N content is not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than\n0.01 mass%. Incidentally, in the case when the C content exceeds 0.05 mass%, or the N content exceeds 0.01 mass%,\ncore loss properties are remarkably reduced due to magnetic aging or the like.\n[0021]Further, in order to make the value R\nTi\n fall within the above-described range, the Ti content is preferably not\nless than 0.1 mass% nor more than 0.3 mass%, and an upper limit of the Ti content is more preferably 0.25 mass%.\n[0022]Note that as metallic elements to form carbonitride in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, Zr, V, Nb, and Mo\nare also cited besides Ti. Among them, precipitation strengthening by Ti carbonitride is remarkable.\n[0023]The components of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet except the above-described components are Fe and\ninevitable impurities, for example. Note that as an aim to avoid embrittlement of the crystal grain boundaries with the\nincrease in tension, B may also be contained. In the above case, a B content is preferably 0.001 mass% or more. On\nthe other hand, when the B content exceeds 0.007 mass%, a reduction in a magnetic flux density, embrittlement at the\ntime of hot rolling, and the like are caused. Thus, the B content is preferably 0.007 mass% or less.\n[0024]Further, as an aim to further improve various types of magnetic properties, Cu: not less than 0.02 mass% nor\nmore than 1.0 mass%, Sn: not less than 0.02 mass% nor more than 0.5 mass%, Sb: not less than 0.02 mass% nor more\nthan 0.5 mass%, Cr: not less than 0.02 mass% nor more than 3.0 mass%, and/or rare earth metal (REM: rare earth\nmetal): not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass% may also be contained. That is, one kind or more of the\nelement (elements) selected from a group consisting of these plural kinds of elements may also be contained.\n[0025]Then, the tensile strength of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet composed of these components becomes,\nfor example, 900 MPa or more. Therefore, a rotor of a high-speed rotary machine manufactured by using the above\nnon-   oriented electrical steel sheet can achieve sufficient high-speed rotation.\n[0026]Further, a high-frequency core loss W\n10/1000\n of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet composed of these\ncomponents becomes, for example, 100 W/kg or less. Therefore, a rotor of a high-speed rotary machine manufactured\nby using the above non-oriented electrical steel sheet can contribute to high-efficiency and miniaturization of the rotary\nmachine. That is, energy loss caused by converting from electric energy into mechanical energy and heat generation\nincidental to the conversion can be suppressed. Then, in order to reduce an eddy current loss to thereby make the high-\nfrequency core loss W\n10/1000\n become 100 W/kg or less, a thickness of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is preferably\n0.30 mm or less.\n[0027]The present inventors confirmed these effects by the following experiments. First, a slab containing C: 0.017\nmass%, Si: 3.12 mass%, Al: 0.65 mass%, Ni: 2.54 mass%, P: 0.02 mass%, N: 0.003 mass%, and Ti: 0.18 mass% was\nhot-   rolled, and a hot-rolled steel sheet was obtained. The value R\nTi\n of the above hot-rolled steel sheet is 2.3. Next, the\nhot-   rolled steel sheet was cold-rolled to have four types of thicknesses shown in Table 1, and a cold-rolled steel sheet\nwas obtained. Thereafter, continuous finish annealing at 780°C for 20 seconds was applied to the cold-rolled steel sheet,\nand a non-oriented electrical steel sheet was obtained. Then, Epstein samples and tensile test pieces were cut out from\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and magnetic properties and mechanical properties were measured by using\nthem. Results thereof are also shown in Table 1. In Tables as below, \"W\n15/50\n\" represents a core loss W\n15/50\n, \"B50\"\nrepresents a magnetic flux density B50, and \"W\n10/1000\n\" represents the core loss W\n10/1000\n. Further, \"YP\" represents a\nyield point, \"TS\" represents the tensile strength, and \"EL\" represents elongation.\n[0028][Table 1]\n\nEP 2 390 376 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0029]As shown in Table 1, although in Samples No. 1 and No. 2, the tensile strength of 900 MPa or more was\nobtained and Samples No. 1 and No. 2 had the high tension, the high-frequency core loss W\n10/1000\n exceeded 100 W/kg.\nThis is because the thicknesses of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet exceed 0.03 mm.\n[0030]For the above reason as well, the thickness of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is preferably 0.30 mm or\nless.\n[0031]Incidentally, the non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to the present invention can be manufactured in\nthe following manner, for example. First, a slab having the above-described composition is melted, and the above slab\nis heated and hot rolled to obtain a hot-rolled steel sheet. Next, the above hot-rolled steel sheet is cold rolled to obtain\na cold-rolled steel sheet. Thereafter, finish annealing is performed. Incidentally, in order to avoid a reduction in strength\nand embrittlement accompanying growth of crystal grains, hot-rolled sheet annealing is preferably not performed, and\nintermediate annealing during cold rolling is also preferably not performed. As long as the hot-rolled steel sheet having\nthe above-described composition is used, the effects of the improvement in tension and the reduction in a high-frequency\ncore loss can be obtained without performing hot-rolled sheet annealing and intermediate annealing. Further, hot-rolled\nsheet annealing is omitted, thereby also enabling bending workability to be improved. That is, since the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet according to the present invention has the above-described composition, the improvement in tension\nand the reduction in a high-frequency core loss can be achieved by the relatively simple processes.\nEXAMPLE\n(First Experiment)\n[0032]First, slabs containing components shown in Table 2 and a balance being composed of Fe and inevitable\nimpurities were hot rolled to obtain hot-rolled steel sheets. Next, the hot-rolled steel sheets were cold rolled to obtain\ncold-  rolled steel sheets having thicknesses of 0.20 mm. Thereafter, continuous finish annealing at 750°C for 30 seconds\nwas applied to the cold-rolled steel sheets to obtain non-oriented electrical steel sheets.\n[0033][Table 2]\n[0034]Then, Epstein samples and tensile test pieces were cut out from the non-oriented electrical steel sheets. Next,\nmagnetic properties were measured by using the Epstein samples, and mechanical properties were measured by using\nthe tensile test pieces.

Thereafter, continuous finish annealing at 775°C for 30 seconds\nwas applied to the cold-rolled steel sheets to obtain non-oriented electrical steel sheets.\n[Table 4]\n[0039]Then, Epstein samples and tensile test pieces were cut out from the non-oriented electrical steel sheets.

These motors are\noften used by being rotated at high speed. Accordingly, a non-oriented electrical steel sheet used for an iron core of a\nmotor has been required to improve (reduce) a core loss in a frequency region of 400 Hz to 800 Hz higher than 50 Hz\nto 60 Hz being a commercial frequency. This is because the reduction in core loss reduces power consumption, thereby\nallowing an amount of energy consumption to be reduced.\n[0003]Then,conventionally, as atechnique to improvea coreloss ina highfrequency region,there has been employed\na technique of increasing Si and Al contents to thereby increase electrical resistance. Ti is also contained in a raw\nmaterial of Si and a raw material of Al, and when the Si and Al contents are increased, an amount of Ti to be inevitably\nmixed in a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is also increased.\n[0004]In a treatment process of a noun-oriented electrical steel sheet, or the like, Ti produces inclusions such as TiN,\nTiS and TiC, (which will be sometimes described as Ti inclusions, hereinafter), in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\nThe Ti inclusions hinder the growth of crystal grains at the time of annealing of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet\nand suppress the improvement of a magnetic property. Particularly, a large number of Ti inclusions are likely to be finely\nprecipitated in grain boundaries during stress relief annealing. Further, there is sometimes a case that a customer stamps\na non-oriented electrical steel sheet shipped by a manufacturer, and thereafter performs stress relief annealing, for\nexample, at 750 ̊C for two hours or so to thereby grow crystal grains. In the above case, even if Ti inclusions are extremely\nreduced at the time of shipment, but after the customer performs the stress relief annealing, a large number of Ti\ninclusionsaretoexistinthenon-orientedelectricalsteelsheet.Thus,eventhoughthestressreliefannealingisperformed,\nthe growth of crystal grains is suppressed by a large number of Ti inclusions, so that it is difficult to sufficiently improve\nthe magnetic property.\n[0005]In order to reduce the Ti inclusions, it is conceivable to use a raw material having a reduced Ti content as the\nraw material of Si and the raw material of Al, but such a raw material is very expensive. Further, it is also conceivable\nto reduce N, S, and C contents in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. It is technically possible to reduce the S and\nC contents by a vacuum degassing treatment or the like, but a prolonged treatment is required and productivity reduces.\nFurther, a large amount of N is contained in the atmosphere, so that it is difficult to avoid N mixing in molten steel. Even\nthough sealing of a refining vessel is enhanced, the manufacturing cost is only increased, so that it is difficult to sufficiently\nsuppress the mixture of N.\nCITATION LIST\nPATENT LITERATURE\n[0006]\nPatent Literature 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-016278\nPatent Literature 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2007-162062\nPatent Literature 3: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2008-132534\nPatent Literature 4: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 09-316535\nPatent Literature 5: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 08-188825\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nTECHNICAL PROBLEM\n[0007]An object of the present invention is to provide a non-oriented electrical steel sheet and a manufacturing method\nthereof capable of suppressing an increase in core loss due to production of Ti inclusions.\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nSOLUTION TO PROBLEM\n[0008]The gist of the present invention is as follows.\n[0009]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to a first aspect of the present invention ischaracterized in\nthatit contains: Si: not less than 1.0 mass% nor more than 3.5 mass%; Al: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 3.0\nmass%; Mn: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 2.0 mass%; Ti: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01\nmass%; and Bi: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%, a C content being 0.01 mass% or less, a P\ncontent being 0.1 mass% or less, a S content being 0.005 mass% or less, a N content being 0.005 mass% or less, and\na balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities, wherein, when a Ti content (mass%) is represented as [Ti]\nand a Bi content (mass%) is represented as [Bi], (1) expression described below is satisfied.\n[0010]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to a second aspect of the present invention ischaracterized\nin that in addition to the characteristic of the first aspect, (2) expression described below is further satisfied.\n[0011]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to a third aspect of the present invention ischaracterized in\nthatit contains Si: not less than 1.0 mass% nor more than 3.5 mass%; Al: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 3.0\nmass%; Mn: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 2.0 mass%; Ti: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01\nmass%; Bi: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%; and at least one selected from a group consisting\nof REM and Ca, a C content being 0.01 mass% or less, a P content being 0.1 mass% or less, a S content being 0.01\nmass% or less, a N content being 0.005 mass% or less, and a balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities,\nwherein, when a Ti content (mass%) is represented as [Ti] and a Bi content (mass%) is represented as [Bi], (1) expression\ndescribed below is satisfied, and when the S content (mass%) is represented as [S], a REM content (mass%) is repre-\nsented as [REM], and a Ca content (mass%) is represented as [Ca], (3) expression described below is satisfied.\n[0012]Incidentally, REM is a generic term used to refer to 17 elements in total, including 15 elements of lanthanum\nwith an atomic number of 57 to lutetium with an atomic number of 71, and scandium with an atomic number of 21 and\nyttrium with an atomic number of 39.\nADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION\n[0013]According to the present invention, an appropriate amount of Bi is contained, so that it is possible to suppress\nproduction of Ti inclusions to thereby suppress an increase in core loss due to the production of Ti inclusions.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n[0014]\n[Fig. 1] Fig. 1 is a view showing a result of examinations;\n[Fig. 2] Fig. 2 is a view showing a range of a Ti content and a Bi content;\n[Fig. 3] Fig. 3 is a view showing one example of an addition method of Bi; and\n[Fig. 4] Fig. 4 is a view showing a change in the Bi content.\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0015]The inventors of the present invention newly found out by experiments to be described below that in the case\nof an appropriate amount of Bi being contained in a non-oriented electrical steel sheet, Ti inclusions (TiN, TiS, and TiC)\nafter annealing is performed are reduced, crystal grains are likely to grow, and a magnetic property is improved.\n[0016]The inventors of the present invention first prepared, steel for a non-oriented electrical steel sheet with a vacuum\nmelting furnace and solidified the steels to thereby obtain slabs. Next, hot rolling of the slabs was performed to obtain\nhot-rolled steel sheets, and annealing of the hot-rolled steel sheets was performed to obtain annealed steel sheets.\nThereafter, cold rolling of the annealed steel sheets was performed to obtain cold-rolled steel sheets, and finish annealing\nofthecold-rolledsteelsheetswasperformedtoobtainnon-orientedelectricalsteelsheets.Further,stressreliefannealing\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheets was performed. Incidentally, as the steels for the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet, there were used ones having various compositions each containing Si: not less than 1.0 mass% nor more than\n3.5 mass%, Al: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 3.0 mass%, Mn: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 2.0\nmass%, and Ti: not less than 0.0005 mass% nor more than 0.02 mass%, a C content being 0.01 mass% or less, a P\ncontent being 0.1 mass% or less, a S content being 0.005 mass% or less, a N content being 0.005 mass% or less, a\nBi content being 0.02 mass% or less, and a balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities. Then, examinations\nof Ti inclusions, crystal grains, and magnetic property were conducted.\n[0017]In the examination of Ti inclusions, first, the non-oriented electrical steel sheets were each mirror-polished from\nthesurfacetoapredeterminedthicknesstomanufacturesamplesforinclusionexamination.Then,predeterminedetching\nwas performed on the samples, and then replicas of the samples were taken, and Ti inclusions transferred to the replicas\nwere observed with a field emission-type transmission electron microscope and a field emission-type scanning electron\nmicroscope. In the etching, the samples were subjected to electrolytic etching in a non-aqueous solvent, with the use\nof a method proposed by Kurosawa et al. (Fumio Kurosawa, Isao Taguchi, and Ryutaro Matsumoto: Journal of The\nJapan Institute of Metals, 43 (1979), p. 1068). According to the above etching method, it is possible to dissolve only a\nbase material (the steel) with Ti inclusions remaining in the sample, and to extract the Ti inclusions.\n[0018]In the examination of grain diameters, the cross sections of the non-oriented electrical steel sheets after the\nfinish annealing were mirror-polished to manufacture samples for crystal grain diameter examination. Then, the samples\nwere subjected to nital etching to allow crystal grains to appear, and an average grain diameter was measured.\n[0019]In the examination of magnetic property, samples each having a length of 25 cm were cut out of the non-\noriented electrical steel sheets, and were subjected to measurement with the use of the Epstein method in accordance\nwith JIS-C-2550.\n[0020]Incidentally, amounts of TiN, TiS, and metallic Bi, inclusions hardly change before and after the stress relief\nannealing, but TiC is produced in the stress relief annealing. Thus, in order to conduct the examinations of Ti inclusions\nmore securely, in the examinations of TiN and TiS, the samples were manufactured from the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheets before the stress relief annealing, and in the examination of TiC, the samples were manufactured from the\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheets after the stress relief annealing.\n[0021]A result of these examinations is shown in Fig. 1.\n[0022]In Fig. 1,3marks each indicate the sample having a large number of Ti inclusions existing therein and having\nthe poor magnetic property. In these samples, 1310\n8\npieces to 3310\n9\npieces of TiN and TiS each having an equivalent\nspherical diameter of 0.01mm to 0.05mm existed per 1 mm\n3\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and 5 pieces to\n50 pieces of TiC having an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.01mm to 0.05mm existed per 1mm of the grain boundary.\nIt is conceivable that these Ti inclusions hinder the growth of crystal grains and thereby the magnetic property becomes\npoor.\n[0023]In Fig. 1,nmarks each indicate the sample having a large number of metallic Bi inclusions existing therein\nand having the poor magnetic property. In these samples, metallic Bi inclusions each being an element having an\nequivalent spherical diameter of 0.1mm to a fewmm, and/or inclusions in which MnS and a metallic Bi are compositely\nprecipitated, each having an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.1mm to a fewmm were observed. Then, 50 pieces to\n2000 pieces of them in total existed per 1 mm\n3\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. The metallic Bi inclusion is one\nin which supersaturated Bi is precipitated. Further, the inclusion in which MnS and the metallic Bi are compositely\nprecipitated is one in which MnS and a metallic Bi are compositely precipitated because an affinity between Bi and MnS\nis strong. It is conceivable that these inclusions each containing the metallic Bi hinder the growth of crystal grains, thereby\nmaking the magnetic property poor. Incidentally, the metallic Bi inclusions are conceivably produced because Bi is not\ncompletely solid-dissolved in a matrix and is not completely segregated in grain boundaries.\n[0024]In Fig. 1,smarks each indicate the sample having reduced Ti inclusions and metallic Bi inclusions and having\nthegoodmagneticproperty.Further,&markseachindicatethesampleinwhichnoTiinclusionsandmetallicBiinclusions\nwere observed and the magnetic property was better.\n[0025]Based on the result shown in Fig. 1, it is found out that even in the case of a small Ti content in the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, when the Bi content is less than 0.001 masts%, a large number of Ti inclusions exist and thereby\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nthe magnetic property sometimes becomes poor. Thus, the Bi content of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is\nnecessary to be 0.001 mass% or more.\n[0026]Further, it is also found out that as the Ti content of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet becomes higher,\nthe Bi content necessary for obtaining the good magnetic property also becomes higher. However, when the Bi content\nexceeds 0.01 mass%, a large number of inclusions containing Bi exist, and thereby the magnetic property becomes\npoor. Consequently, the Bi content of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is required to be 0.01 mass% or less.\n[0027]Further, it is also found out that in the case when the Bi content falls within the range of not less than 0.001\nmass% nor more than 0.01 mass% and the Ti content is fixed, Ti inclusions are reduced with the increase in Bi content.\nThen, from the result shown in Fig. 1, a boundary between a region in which3marks are obtained and a region in which\nsmarks are obtained is expressed by (1’) expression described below when the Bi content falls within the range of not\nless than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%. Here, [Ti] represents the Ti content (mass%) of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, and [Bi] represents the Bi content (mass%) of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Then, if the\nTi content (left side) is equal to or less than the value on the right side, namely (1) expression is established,smarks\nare obtained.\n[0028]Furthermore, from the result shown in Fig. 1, a boundary between the region in whichsmarks are obtained\nand a region in which&marks are obtained is expressed by (2’) expression described below when the Bi content falls\nwithin the range of not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%. Then, if the Ti content (left side) is equal to\nor less than the value on the right side, namely (2) expression is established,& marks are obtained.\n[0029]According to these expressions, it is obvious that, for example, in the case of the Ti content being 0.006 mass%,\nwhen the Bi content is less than 0.005 mass%, the result of3mark is obtained, and when the Bi content exceeds 0.005\nmass%, the result ofsmark is obtained, and when the Bi content exceeds 0.007 mass%, the result of&mark is\nobtained. That is, it is obvious that with the increase in Bi content, Ti inclusions are reduced, and as the Bi content\nbecomes much higher, an effect of reducing Ti inclusions is further enhanced. Such a phenomenon was clarified by the\ninventors of the present invention through the above examinations for the first time. That is, as a result of these exam-\ninations, it became obvious that in the case when an appropriate amount of Bi is contained in the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet, Ti inclusions after the annealing is performed are reduced and crystal grains are likely to grow, and thereby\nthe magnetic property is improved.\n[0030]Incidentally, in the case of the Ti content of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet being less than 0.001 mass%,\nthe Ti content is extremely small, resulting in that almost no Ti inclusions are produced. Thus, it is conceivable that in\nthe case of the Ti content bering less than 0.001 mass%, the effect of reducing Ti inclusions is hardly obtained.\n[0031]A mechanism in which the production of Ti inclusions is suppressed in the case of an appropriate amount of\nBi being contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet has not been clarified. However, considering that the effect\nis obtained even though the Bi content is a little, which is at most 0.001 mass% or so, and no Bi inclusions are observed,\nit is conceivable that Bi solid-dissolved in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet and/or Bi segregated in crystal grain\nboundariesexhibit/exhibitsafunctiontoreduceTiinclusions.Thus,asshowninFig.1,(1)expression,and(2)expression,\nit is conceivable that as the Ti content becomes larger, the Bi content necessary for reducing Ti inclusions is increased,\nand a proportional relationship is established between the Ti content and the Bi content.\n[0032]As above, it became obvious that in the case when Bi of not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%\nis contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, as long as (1) expression is satisfied, it is possible to reduce Ti\ninclusions and metallic Bi inclusions to thereby improve the growth of crystal grains and the magnetic property, and as\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nlong as (2) expression is satisfied, it is possible to further reduce Ti inclusions and metallic Bi inclusions to thereby further\nimprove the growth of crystal grains and the magnetic property.\n[0033]Fig. 2 shows a range of the Ti content and the Bi content, in which the above-described examinations are\nconducted, and a range of Bi: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass% and Ti: 0.001 mass% and in which\n(1) expression or (2) expression is satisfied.\n[0034]Further, the inventors of the present invention also conducted an experiment regarding the effect of S in the\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheet. Also in this experiment, first, steels for a non-oriented electrical steel sheet were\nprepared with a vacuum melting furnace, and the steels were solidified to obtain slabs. Next, hot rolling of the slabs was\nperformed to obtain hot-rolled steel sheets, and annealing of the hot-rolled steel sheets was performed to obtain annealed\nsteel sheets. Thereafter, cold rolling of the annealed steel sheets was performed to obtain cold-rolled steel sheets, and\nfinish annealing of the cold-rolled steel sheets was performed to obtain non-oriented electrical steel sheets. Further,\nstress relief annealing of the non-oriented electrical steel sheets was performed. Incidentally, as the steels for the non-\noriented electrical steel sheet, there were used ones having various compositions each containing Si: not less than 1.0\nmass% nor more than 3.5 mass%, Al: not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 3.0 mass%, Mn: not less than 0.1 mass%\nnor more than 2.0 mass%, Ti: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%, Bi: not less than 0.001 mass%\nnor more than 0.01 mass%, and S: not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.015 mass%, a C content being 0.01\nmass% or less, a P content being 0.1 mass% or less, a N content being 0.005 mass% or less, a REM content being\n0.03% or less, a Ca content being 0.005% or less, and a balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities. Then,\nsimilarly to the above-described experiment, examinations of Ti inclusions, crystal grains, and magnetic property were\nconducted.\n[0035]As a result, it was found out that even in the case when (1) expression or (2) expression is satisfied, the good\nmagnetic property is sometimes not obtained.\n[0036]As a result of earnest studies on the above cause, it was found out that in the case of S being contained in the\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheet, Bi is compositely precipitated in MnS, so that the amount of Bi exhibiting the function\nto reduce Ti inclusions is reduced. Particularly, as a larger amount of MnS exists in the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet, the amount of Bi to be compositely precipitated in MnS is also increased, so that Ti inclusions are not likely to be\nreduced.\n[0037]Thus, it is important that in the case of a certain amount or more of S being contained in the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, MnS is reduced to thereby reduce the amount of Bi to be compositely precipitated in MnS, and\nthereby the amount of Bi contributing to the reduction in Ti inclusions is secured.\n[0038]In order to reduce MnS, it is effective to reduce an amount of free S in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\nIn the experiment in Fig. 1, it was possible to secure the amount of Bi contributing to the reduction in Ti inclusion if (1)\nexpression or (2) expression was satisfied. Accordingly, it is conceivable that if the amount of free S is reduced to the\nsame extent as that in the experiment in Fig. 1 (0.005 mass% or less), the amount of Bi contributing to the reduction in\nTi inclusions can be secured.\n[0039]Based on such knowledge, the inventors of the present invention found out that even in the case when S being\nlarger than 0.005 mass% is contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, as long as an appropriate amount of at\nleast one type of REM and Ca being desulfurizing elements is contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet,\nsulfides of REM or Ca are produced, so that the amount of free S is reduced to 0.005 mass% or less, thereby allowing\nthe amount of Bi contributing to the reduction in Ti inclusions to be secured.\n[0040]That is, as a result of examination of a relationship between MnS and metallic Bi inclusions in the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet, which was conducted by the inventors of the present invention, it became obvious that in the case\nof (3) expression described below being satisfied, metallic Bi inclusions are not likely to be compositely precipitated in\nMnS. Here, [S] represents a S content (mass%) of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, [REM] represents the REM\ncontent (mass%) of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and [Ca] represents the Ca content (mass%) of the non-\noriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0041]REM turns to oxides, oxysulfides, and/or sulfides in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. When a mass ratio\nof S to REM in REM oxysulfides and REM sulfides was examined, the mass ratio was 0.23 on the average.\n[0042]Ca produces Ca. sulfides in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. A mass ratio of S to Ca in Ca sulfides is\n0.8, but as a result of examination, half an amount of Ca in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet produced Ca sulfides.\nThat is, the mass ratio of S to Ca in Ca sulfides was 0.4.\n[0043]From the results of these examinations, the amount of free S from which S fixed by REM inclusions or Ca\ninclusions is eliminated is expressed by the left side of (3) expression. Then, if the above value of the amount is 0.005\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nmass% or less, metallic Bi inclusions to be compositely precipitated in MnS are significantly reduced, thereby allowing\nthe amount of Bi contributing to the reduction in Ti inclusions to be secured.\n[0044]Such a functional effect of Bi is to bring about the reduction in Ti inclusions in the non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet. That is, Bi suppresses precipitations of TiN and TiS in the annealing of the hot-rolled sheet and the finish annealing\nof the cold-rolled sheet, and further suppresses precipitation of TiC in the stress relief annealing.\n[0045]Next, the reason of limiting components of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet will be explained.\n[0046][C] : C forms TiC in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to cause deterioration of the magnetic property.\nFurther, magnetic aging becomes noticeable by precipitation of C. Thus, the C content is set to 0.01 mass% or less. C\nneeds not be contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, but when the cost required for decarburization is\nconsidered, the C content, is preferably 0.0005 mass% or more.\n[0047][Si]: Si is an element to reduce a core loss. When a Si content is less than 1.0 mass%, a core loss cannot be\nreduced sufficiently. On the other hand, when the Si content exceeds 3.5 mass%, workability is reduced significantly.\nThus, the Si content is not less than 1.0 mass% nor more than 3.5 mass%. In order to further reduce a core loss, the\nSi content is preferably 1.5 mass% or more, and is more preferably 2.0 mass% or more. Further, in order to further\nimprove workability at the time of cold rolling, the Si content is preferably 3.1 mass% or less, and is more preferably 3.0\nmass% or less, and is still more preferably 2.5 mass%.\n[0048][Al]: Al is, similarly to Si, an element to reduce a core loss. When an Al content is less than 0.1 mass%, a core\nloss cannot be reduced sufficiently. On the other hand, when the Al content exceeds 3.0 mass%, an increase in cost\nbecomes noticeable. Thus, the Al content is not less than 0.1 mass% nor more than 3.0 mass%. In order to further\nreduce a core loss, the Al content is preferably 0.2 mass% or more, and is more preferably 0.3 mass% or more, and is\nstill more preferably 0.4 mass% or more. Further, for reducing the cost, the Al content is preferably 2.5 mass% or less,\nand is more preferably 2.0 mass% or less, and is still more preferably 1.8 mass% or less.\n[0049][Mn]: Mn increases the hardness of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to improve a stamping property.\nWhen a Mn content is less than 0.1 mass%, such an effect is not obtained. On the other hand, when the Mn content\nexceeds 2.0 mass%, an increase in cost becomes noticeable. Thus, the Mn content is not less than 0.1 mass% nor\nmore than 2.0 mass%.\n[0050][P]: P increases the strength of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to improve its workability. When the P\ncontent is less than 0.0001 mass%, such an effect is not likely to be obtained. Thus, the P content is preferably 0.0001\nmass% or more. On the other hand, when the P content exceeds 0.1 mass%, workability at cold rolling is reduced. Thus,\nthe P content is 0.1 mass% or less.\n[0051][Bi]: Bi suppresses the production of Ti inclusions as described above, but when the Bi content is less than\n0.001 mass%, such an effect is not obtained. On the other hand, when the Bi content exceeds 0.01 mass%, metallic Bi\ninclusions is produced, and inclusions in which MnS and metallic Bi are compositely precipitated are produced, and\nthereby the growth of crystal grains is hindered and the good magnetic property is not obtained, as described above.\nThus, the Bi content is not less than 0.001 mass% nor more than 0.01 mass%. In order to further suppress the production\nof Ti inclusion, the Bi content is preferably 0.0015% or more, and is more preferably 0.002% or more, and is still more\npreferably0.003%ormoreFurther,forthereductionincost,theBicontentispreferably0.005mass%orless.Furthermore,\nas described above, (1) expression is required to be satisfied, and (2) expression is preferably satisfied.\n[0052][S]: S produces sulfides such as TiS and MnS. Then, TiS prevents the growth of crystal grains to thereby\nincrease a core loss. Further, MnS functions as a site in which metallic Bi is compositely precipitated, and reduces the\neffect of suppressing the production of Ti inclusions by Bi. Thus, in the case when later-described amounts of REM and\nCa are not contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, the S content is 0.005 mass% or less, and is preferably\n0.003 mass% or less. On the other hand, in the case when the later-described amounts of REM and Ca are contained\nin the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, the S content may also exceed 0.005 mass%, but the S content is 0.01 mass%.\nThis is because when the S content exceeds 0.01 mass%, sulfides of REM and Ca are increased to thereby hinder the\ngrowth of crystal grains. Incidentally, the S content may also be 0 mass%.\n[0053][N]: N produces nitrides such as TiN to make a core loss deteriorate. Thus, the N content is 0.005 mass% or\nmess, and is preferably 0.003 mass% or less, and is more preferably 0.0025 mass% or less, and is still more preferably\n0.002 mass% or less. However, it is difficult to eliminate N completely, so that N may remain in the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet and the N content may also be larger than 0 mass%. For example, the N content may also be 0.001 mass%\nor more in consideration of denitrification available in an industrial manufacturing process. Further, in the case when\ndenitrification is performed extremely, when the N content is reduced to 0.0005 mass%, nitrides are further reduced, so\nthat it is preferable.\n[0054][Ti]: Ti produces Ti precipitates of TiN, TiS, TiC, and so on (fine inclusions) to thereby hinder the growth of\ncrystal grains and make a core loss deteriorate. The production of these fine inclusions is suppressed because Bi is\ncontained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and as described above, (1) expression is satisfied between the Bi\ncontent and the Ti content. Further, the Bi content is 0.01 mass% or less. Thus, the Ti content is 0.01 mass% or less.\nFurther, as described above, (2) expression is preferably satisfied. Incidentally, in the case of the Ti content being less\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nthan 0.001 mass%, a produced amount of Ti precipitates becomes extremely small, and thereby the growth of crystal\ngrains is hardly hindered even though Bi is not contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. That is, in the case\nof the Ti content being less than 0.001 mass%, the effect ascribable to the content of Bi is not likely to appear. Thus,\nthe Ti content is 0.001 mass% or more.\n[0055][REM] and [Ca]: REM and Ca are desulfurizing elements to fix S in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet and\nsuppress the production of sulfide inclusions such as MnS. Thus, in the case when the S content larger than 0.005\nmass% is contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, (3) expression is required to be satisfied. In order to obtain\nthe above effect more securely, the REM content is preferably 0.001 mass% or more, and the Ca content is preferably\n0.0003 mass% or more. On the other hand, when the REM content exceeds 0.02 mass%, the cost is increased signif-\nicantly.Further,whentheCacontentexceeds0.0125mass%,ameltinglossofafurnacerefractoryandthelikesometimes\noccur. Thus, the REM content is preferably 0.02 mass% or less, and the Ca content is preferably 0.0125 mass% or less.\nIncidentally, the type of element of REM is not limited in particular, and only one type may be contained, or two types\nor more may also be contained, and as long as (3) expression is satisfied, the effect is obtained.\n[0056]In the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, elements described below may also be contained. Incidentally, these\nelements need not be contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, but if even a small amount of the elements\nis contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, the effect is achieved. Thus, a content of these elements is\npreferably larger than 0 mass%.\n[0057][Cu] : Cu improves the corrosion resistance and further increases the resistivity to thereby improve a core loss.\nIn order to obtain the above effect, a Cu content is preferably 0.005 mass% or more. However, when the Cu content\nexceeds 0.5 mass%, scab and the like occur on the surface of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and thereby the\nsurface quality is likely to deteriorate. Thus, the Cu content is preferably 0.5 mass% or less.\n[0058][Cr]: Cr improves the corrosion resistance and further increases the resistivity to thereby improve a core loss.\nIn order to obtain the above effect, a Cr content is preferably 0.005 mass% or more. However, when the Cr content\nexceeds 20 mass%, the cost is likely to be increased. Thus, the Cr content is preferably 20 mass% or less.\n[0059][Sn] and [Sb]: Sn and Sb are segregation elements and hinder the growth of a texture on the (111) plane, which\nmakes the magnetic property deteriorate, to thereby improve the magnetic property. Even though only either Sn or Sb\nis contained, or both Sn and Sb are contained in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, the effect is obtained. In order\nto obtain the effect, a content of Sn and Sb is preferably 0.001 mass% or more in total. However, when the content of\nSn and Sb exceeds 0.3 mass% in total, workability in the cold rolling is likely to deteriorate. Thus, the content of Sn and\nSb is preferably 0.3 mass% or less in total.\n[0060][Ni]: Ni develops a texture advantageous to the magnetic property to thereby improve a core loss. In order to\nobtain the above effect, a Ni content is preferably 0.001 mass% or more. However, when the Ni content exceeds 1.0\nmass%, the cost is likely to be increased. Thus, the Ni content is preferably 1.0 mass% or less.\n[0061]Incidentally, as the inevitable impurities, ones in the following are cited.\n[0062][Zr]: Zr, even in a small amount, is likely to hinder the growth of crystal grains, and thereby a core loss after\nthe stress relief annealing is likely to deteriorate. Thus, a Zr content is preferably 0.01 mass% or less.\n[0063][V] : V is lively to produce nitrides or carbides and is likely to hinder the displacement of a magnetic domain\nwall and the growth of crystal grains. Thus, a V content is preferably 0.01 mass% or less.\n[0064][Mg] : Mg is a desulfurizing element and reacts with S in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to produce\nsulfides and fixes S. As a Mg content is increased, a desulfurizing effect is enhanced, but when the Mg content exceeds\n0.05 mass%, Mg sulfides are produced excessively and thereby the growth of crystal grains is likely to be prevented.\nThus, the Mg content is preferably 0.05 mass% or less.\n[0065][O] : When an O content that is dissolved and non-dissolved exceeds 0.005 mass% in total amount, a large\nnumber of oxides is produced, and thereby the oxides are likely to hinder the displacement of a magnetic domain wall\nand the growth of crystal grains. Thus, the O content is preferably 0.005 mass% or less.\n[0066][B]: B is a grain boundary segregation element and further produces nitrides. B nitrides hinder the migration\nof grain boundaries, and thereby a core loss is likely to deteriorate. Thus, a B content is preferably 0.005 mass% or less.\n[0067]According to the non-oriented electrical steel sheet as above, it is possible to suppress a core loss low even\nthough the annealing such as stress relief annealing is performed thereafter. That is, the occurrence of Ti inclusions at\nthe time of annealing is suppressed to sufficiently grow crystal grains, and thereby it is possible to obtain a low core\nloss. Accordingly, the good magnetic property can be obtained without using a method of causing a noticeable increase\nin cost or a noticeable reduction in productivity. Then, in the case when the non-oriented electrical steel sheet as above\nis used for a motor, energy consumption can be reduced.\n[0068]Next, an embodiment of a manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet will be explained.\n[0069]First, at a steelmaking stage, steel is refined with a converter, a secondary refining furnace, or the like, and\nthe molten steel with the contents of the respective elements except Bi falling within the above-described ranges is\nproduced. At this time, in the case when desulfurization is performed until the S content becomes 0.005 mass% or less,\nREM and Ca are not required to be added to then steel, but in the case when desulfurization is performed until the S\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\ncontent becomeslarger than0.005 mass% and01 mass%orless, REM and/orCa are/is added tothe steelin asecondary\nrefining furnace or the like such that (3) expression is satisfied.\n[0070]Thereafter, the molten steel is received in a ladle, and the molten steel is poured into a mold through a tundish\nwhile adding Bi to the molten steel, and by continuous casting or ingot casting, a cast steel such as a slab is produced.\nThat is, Bi is added to the molten steel in the middle of being poured into the mold. At this time, Bi is preferably added\nto the molten steel immediately before the molten steel is poured into the mold as much as possible. This is because\nthe boiling point of Bi is 1560 ̊C, but the temperature of the molten steel at the time of being poured into the mold is\nhigher than 1560 ̊C, so that Bi poured into the mold early is vaporized over time to be lost.\n[0071]Theinventorsofthepresentinventionfoundoutintheexperimentthatheating,dissolving,boiling,andvaporizing\nof Bi by the molten steel become noticeable after three minutes and later after the addition of Bi. Thus, in terms of a\nyield of Bi, Bi is preferably added to the molten steel such that the time period from the addition of Bi to the start of\nsolidification of the molten steel becomes three minutes or shorter. For example, as shown in Fig. 3, it is preferable that\na wire-shaped metallic Bi 11 is supplied to molten steel 10 in the vicinity of a pouring port 3, provided at a bottom portion\nof a tundish 1, into a mold 2. According to the above method, it is possible to adjust the time period from the dissolution\nof the metallic Bi 11 in the molten steel 10 to the start of solidification of the molten steel 10 in the mold 2 to within three\nminutes. The molten steel 10 is solidified and then is discharged as a cast steel 12, and the cast steel 12 is conveyed\nby a conveyor roller 4.\n[0072]Incidentally, the yield of Bi varies depending on the temperature of the molten steel and the timing of the\naddition, but falls within a range of 5% to 15% on the whole, and if the yield of Bi is measured in advance, it is possible\nto determine its amount to be added in consideration of the yield.\n[0073]Further, metallic Bi may also be added to the molten steel directly, but if Bi is covered with Fe or the like to be\nadded to the molten steel, the loss due to vaporization is reduced, thereby allowing the yield to be improved.\n[0074]Thus, in order to set the Bi content of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to not less than 0.001% nor more\nthan 0.01%, it is preferable that the yield of Bi when Bi covered with, for example, Fe is added to the molten steel is\nmeasured in advance according to a relationship between the temperature of the molten steel and the timing of the\naddition, and the amount of Bi in which the value of the above yield is considered is added to the molten steel at\npredetermined timing.\n[0075]After the cast steel is obtained in this manner, the cast steel is hot rolled to obtain a hot-rolled steel sheet.\nThen, the hot-rolled steel sheet is hot-rolled sheet annealed according to need and then is cold rolled, and thereby a\ncold-rolled steel sheet is obtained. The thickness of the cold-rolled steel sheet is set to the thickness of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet to be manufactured, for example. The cold rolling may be performed only one time, or may also\nbe performed two times or more with intermediate annealing therebetween. Subsequently, the cold-rolled steel sheet\nis finish-annealed, and an insulating film is coated thereon. According to the method as above, it is possible to obtain\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet in which the occurrence of Ti inclusions is suppressed.\n[0076]Incidentally, the method of examining the inclusions, the method of measuring the magnetic property, and the\nlike are not limited to the ones described above. For example, it is also possible that in the examination of Ti inclusions,\nthe replica method is not employed but thin film samples are made and Ti inclusions are observed with the use of a field\nemission-type transmission electron microscope.\nEXAMPLE\n[0077]Next, experiments conducted by the present inventors will be explained. The conditions and so on in the\nexperiments are examples employed for confirming the practicability and the effects of the present invention, and the\npresent invention is not limited to these examples.\n(First Experiment)\n[0078]First, steels each containing C: 0.0017 mass%, Si: 2.9 mass%, Mn: 0.5 mass%, P: 0.09 mass%, S: 0.0025\nmass%, Al: 0.4 mass%, and N: 0.0023 mass%, and further containing components shown in Table 1 and a balance\nbeing composed of Fe and inevitable impurities were refined in a converter and a vacuum degassing apparatus and\neach received in a ladle. Next, the molten steels were each supplied into a mold with an immersion nozzle through a\ntundish, and cast steels were obtained through continuous casting. Incidentally, addition of Bi was performed in a manner\nthat a wire-shaped metallic Bi having a diameter of 5 mm, which was covered with a Fe film having a thickness of 1 mm,\nwas put into the molten steel in the tundish from the position directly above the immersion nozzle to the mold. At this\ntime, the position from which the metallic Bi was put into the molten steel was determined such that the time period from\nthe addition of Bi to the start of solidification of the molten steel became 1.5 minutes.\n[0079]\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n10\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[Table 1]\nNo.\nCOMPOSITION\nCONTENT (MASS%)\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN (1)\nEXPRESS ON AND (2)\nEXPRESSION\nEVALUATION OF Bi CONTENT\nTi\nBi\nCr    Cu\nSn    Sb\nNi\nEXAMPLE\n1    0.0015   0.0013    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n2    0.0016   0.0019    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n3    0.0019   0.0041    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n4    0.0024   0.0020    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n5    0.0028   0.0012    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n6    0.0028   0.0033    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n7    0.0028   0.0080    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n8    0.0028   0.0017    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n9    0.0028   0.0019    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n10   0.0029   0.0016    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n11   0.0035   0.0021    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n12   0.0045   0.0044    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n13   0.0055   0.0052    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n14   0.0066   0.0085    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n15   0.0090   0.0090    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nss\n16   0.0021   0.0014   1.8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n17   0.0028   0.0022    0    0.14\n0\n0\n0\n&\ns\n18   0.0028   0.0029    0\n0\n0.08    0\n0\n&\ns\n19   0.0023   0.0016    0\n0\n0\n0.1\n0\n&\ns\n20   0.0027   0.0024    0\n0\n0\n0    0.45\n&\ns\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n11\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n(continued)\nNo.\nCOMPOSITION\nCONTENT (MASS%)\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN (1)\nEXPRESS ON AND (2)\nEXPRESSION\nEVALUATION OF Bi CONTENT\nTi\nBi\nCr    Cu\nSn    Sb\nNi\nCOMPARATIVE EXAMPLE\n21   0.0028\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n33\n22   0.0055\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n33\n23   0.0104\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n33\n24   0.0018   0.0003    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ns\n3\n25   0.0022   0.0008    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ns\n3\n26   0.0028   0.0005    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\ns\n3\n27   0.0035   0.0011    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n28   0.0045   0.0023    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n29   0.0055   0.0023    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n30   0.0090   0.0020    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n31   0.0090   0.0065    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n32   0.0104   0.0020    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n33   0.0100   0.0090    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\ns\n34   0.0028   0.0130    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\n3\n35   0.0028   0.0200    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\n3\n36   0.0090   0.0120    0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n&\n3\n\nEP 2 439 302 A1\n12\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0080]Thereafter, the cast steels were hot rolled to obtain hot-rolled steel sheets. Next, the hot-rolled steel sheets\nwere hot-rolled sheet annealed and subsequently were cold rolled, and thereby cold-rolled steel sheets each having a\nthickness of 0.35 mm were obtained.

The ex-\naminations of TiN, TiS, and metallic Bi inclusions were conducted by the above-described replica method. Further, in\nthe examination of magnetic property, a core loss W10/800 was measured by the above-described Epstein method in\naccordance with JIS-C-2550. A result thereof is shown in Table 2.

Further, in the section of \"METALLIC Bi INCLUSION\", \"EXISTENCE\" means\nthat in the field of view, 50 pieces to 2000 pierces of metallic Bi inclusions each being an element having an equivalent\nspherical diameter of 0.1mm to a fewmm and inclusions in which MnS and the metallic Bi were compositely precipitated,\neach having an equivalent spherical diameter of 0.1mm to a fewmm existed per 1 mm\n3\nof the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet in total, and \"NONEXISTENCE\" means that the number of such inclusions was less than 50 per 1 mm\n3\nof\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0082]Further, stress relief annealing at 750 ̊C for two hours was performed on the non-oriented electrical steel sheets,\nand then examinations of average grain diameter, TiC, and magnetic property were conducted. The examination of\ncrystal grain diameter was conducted by the above-described method in which nital etching is performed, and the\nexamination of TiC was conducted by the above-described replica method. Further, in the examination of magnetic\nproperty, the core loss W10/800 was measured by the above-described Epstein method in accordance with JIS-C-2550.\nA result thereof is also shown in Table 2.

Then, the values of the core loss\nbefore and after the stress relief annealing were significantly large as compared with those in Examples No. 1 to No.\n20, and crystal grains did not grow very much as compared with Examples No. 1 to No. 20. Further, in Comparative\nExamples No. 27 to No. 33, (1) expression was not satisfied, so that before the stress relief annealing, a large number\nof pieces of TiN and TiS existed, and after the stress relief annealing, a large number of pieces of TiC existed. Then,\nthe values of the core loss before and after the stress relief annealing were significantly large as compared with those\nin Examples No. 1 to No. 20, and crystal grains did not grow very much as compared with Examples No. 1 to No. 20.\nFurthermore, in Comparative Examples No. 34 to No. 36, the Bi content exceeded the upper limit of the range of the\npresent invention, so that before the stress relief annealing, a large number of metallic Bi inclusions existed, and the\nvalues of the core loss before and after the stress relief annealing were significantly large as compared with those in\nExamples No. 1 to No. 20.\n[0086]Incidentally, the states of TiN, TiS, and metallic Bi inclusions hardly change before and after the stress relief\nannealing, but TiC is produced in the stress relief annealing. Thus, in order to conduct the observation of Ti inclusions\nmoresecurely,themeasurementsofTiNandTiSwereconductedbeforethestressreliefannealing,andthemeasurement\nof TiC was conducted after the stress relief annealing.\n(Second Experiment)\n[0087]First, steels each containing C: 0.002 mass%, Si: 3.0 mass%, Mn: 0.20 mass%, P: 0.1 mass%, Al: 1.05 mass%,\nTi: 0.003 mass%, N: 0.002 mass%, and Bi: 0.0025 mass%\n,\nand further containing components shown in Table 3, and\na balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities were melted in a high-frequency vacuum melting apparatus.\nAt this time, a misch metal was added to the molten steels and thereby REM was contained in the steels, and a metallic\nCa was added to the molten steels and thereby Ca was contained in the molten steels. After the molten steels each\nhaving the above-described components were obtained, a metallic Bi was further added to the molten steels directly,\nand thereafter, the molten steels were each poured into a mold and ingots were obtained. Incidentally, the time period\nfrom the addition of the metallic Bi to the start of solidification of the molten steel was set to two minutes.

Next, the hot-rolled\nsteel sheets were hot-rolled sheet annealed, and subsequently were cold rolled, and thereby cold-rolled steel sheets\neach having a thickness of 0.35 mm were obtained. Thereafter, finish annealing at 950 ̊C for 30 seconds was performed\non the cold-rolled steel sheets, and thereby non-oriented electrical steel sheets were obtained.\n[0090]Then, similarly to First Experiment, examinations of TiN, TiS, metallic Bi inclusions, and magnetic property\nwere conducted. A result thereof is shown in Table 4.\n[0091]\n[0092]As shown in Table 4, in Examples No. 41 to No. 47 belonging to the range of the present invention, almost no\nmetallic Bi inclusions compounded with MnS were observed. This is because an amount of MnS was reduced extremely.\nFurther, almost no metallic Bi inclusions were also observed.. Consequently, it is conceivable that almost all Bi in the\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheet was solid dissolved or segregated in grain boundaries. Furthermore, almost no TiN\nand TiS also existed in the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Then, the value of core loss was good.\n[0093]On the other hand, in Comparative Examples No. 48 to 50, (3) expression was not satisfied, so that metallic\nBi inclusions and metallic Bi inclusions compounded with MnS were observed. Further, in Comparative Example No.\n51, the S content exceeded the upper limit of the range of the present invention, so that metallic Bi inclusions and metallic\nBi inclusions compounded with MnS were observed. Consequently, it is obvious that Bi solid-dissolved in the non-\noriented electrical steel sheet or segregated in grain boundaries falls short of 0.0025 mass%. Then, a large number of\npieces of TiN and TiS existed in the non-oriented electrical 1 steel sheet, and the value of core loss was significantly\nlarge as compared with that in Examples No. 41 to No. 47 .\n(Third Experiment)\n[0094]First, a 50-kg steel containing C: 0.002 mass%, Si: 3.0 mass%, Mn: 0.25 mass%, P: 0.1 mass%, Al: 1.0 mass%,\nand N: 0.002 mass%, and a balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurities was melted in a high-frequency\nvacuum melting apparatus. Thereafter, a 20-g metallic Bi was directly added to the molten steel while the temperature\nof the molten steel was maintained at 1600 ̊C, and the molten steel was sampled every after a time shown in Table 5,\nand the Bi content was examined by a chemical analysis.

In particular, since high aluminum (25% to 75%\nby weight) -zinc alloy-plated sheet steel, as represented by 55% aluminum-zinc alloy-plated sheet steel (Galvalume™\nsheet steel), has superior corrosion resistance in comparison with ordinary hot-dipped sheet steel, its demand continues\nto increase. In addition, in response to recent growing demands for further improvement of corrosion resistance and\nworkability of construction materials in particular, the corrosion resistance of hot-dipped Zn-Al-based steel has been\nimproved through the addition of Mg and the like to the plating layer (see PTL 1 to 4).\n[0003]EP 1225246 A1 describes a Zn-Al-Mg-Si alloy-plated steel material.\n[0004]JP 2007284718 A relates to a Zn-Al alloy hot-dip plated steel.\n[0005]However, in the case of high aluminum-zinc alloy-plated sheet steel containing Mg, wrinkles easily form in the\nsurface of the plating layer resulting in the problem of poor appearance of the plated surface. Moreover, since sharp\nprotrusions occur in the surface of the plating layer due to this wrinkling, in the case of forming a chemical conversion\ntreatment layer by carrying out chemical conversion on the plating layer or forming a coating layer by applying a coating\nmaterial and the like, the thickness of the chemical conversion layer or coating layer easily becomes uneven. Conse-\nquently, there is the problem of coating and the like being unable to adequately demonstrate improvement of corrosion\nresistance of plated sheet steel.\n[0006]For example, PTL 1 discloses an hot-dipped Al-based Al-Si-Mg-Zn-plated sheet steel having on the surface\nthereof a hot-dipped plating layer containing, as percentages by weight, 3% to 13% Si, 2% to 8% Mg and 2% to 10%\nZn, with the remainder consisting of Al and unavoidable impurities. PTL 1 discloses that the hot-dipped plating layer\nfurther contains 0.002% to 0.08% Be and 0% to 0.1% Sr, contains 3% to 13% Si, 2% to 8% Mg, 2% to 10% Zn, 0.003%\nto 0.05% Be and 0% to 0.1% Sr, contains 3% to 13% Si, 2% to 8% Mg, 2% to 10% Zn, 0% to 0.003% Be and 0.07% to\n1.7% Sr, contains 3% to 13% Si, 2% to 8% Mg, 2% to 10% Zn, 0% to 0.003% Be and 0.1% to 1.0% Sr, contains 3% to\n13% Si, 2% to 8% Mg, 2% to 10% Zn, 0.003% to 0.08% Be and 0.1% to 1.7% Sr, or contains 3% to 13% Si, 2% to 8%\nMg, 2% to 10% Zn, 0.003% to 0.05% Be and 0.1% to 1.0% Sr.\n[0007]In the technology disclosed in this PTL 1, although corrosion resistance of a hot-dipped steel is attempted to\nbe improved by adding Mg to the plating layer, wrinkles easily form in the plating layer due to the addition of Mg. Although\nit is also described in PTL 1 that wrinkling is inhibited as a result of inhibiting oxidation of Mg by adding Sr or Be to the\nplating layer, inhibition of wrinkling is not adequate.\n[0008]Wrinkles formed in the plating layer in this manner are difficult to be adequately removed even by temper rolling\ntreatment and the like, and cause the appearance of hot-dipped steel to be impaired.\nCITATION LIST\nPATENT LITERATURE\n[0009]\nPTL 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. H11-279735\nPTL 2: Japanese Patent Publication No. 3718479\nPTL 3: WO 2008/025066\nPTL 4: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2007-284718\nPTL5 (= EP 1 225 246 A1) describes a Zn-Al-Mg-Se-alloy-plated steel material.\nPTL 4 (= JP2007-284718) describes a Zn-Al-alloy hot-dip plated steel.\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\nTECHNICAL PROBLEM\n[0010]With the foregoing in view, an object of the present invention is to provide a hot-dipped steel, which demonstrates\nfavorable corrosion resistance and workability, and has a favorable appearance of a plating layer, and a method of\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nproducing the same.\nSOLUTION TO PROBLEM\n[0011]The present invention relates to a hot-dipped steel comprising a steel substrate with an aluminum-zinc alloy\nplating layer formed thereon in accordance with the appended claims, and to a method of producing hot-dipped steel in\naccordance with the appended claims.\n[0012]The inventors of the present invention discussed the following matters regarding the above-mentioned problems.\nDuring hot-dip plating treatment using a hot-dip plating bath containing Mg, since Mg is easily oxidized in comparison\nwith other elements that compose the plating layer, Mg reacts with oxygen in the air on the surface layer of the hot-dip\nplating metal adhered to the steel substrate, resulting in the formation of Mg-based oxides. Accompanying this, Mg\nconcentrates on the surface layer of the hot-dip plating metal, and accelerates the formation of an Mg-based oxide film\n(film composed of metal oxides including Mg) on the surface layer of this hot-dip plating metal. As the hot-dip plating\nmetal cools and solidifies, since the Mg-based oxide film is formed before solidification inside the hot-dip plating metal\nis completed, a difference in fluidity occurs between the surface layer of the hot-dip plating metal and the inside thereof.\nConsequently, even if the inside of the hot-dip plating metal is still fluid, the Mg-based oxide film of the surface layer is\nno longer able to follow that flow, and wrinkling and running are thought to occur as a result thereof.\n[0013]Therefore, the inventors of the present invention conducted extensive studies to inhibit differences in fluidity\nwithin the hot-dip plating metal during hot-dip plating treatment as described above while ensuring favorable corrosion\nresistance and workability of a hot-dipped steel, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.\n[0014]The hot-dipped steel according to the present invention includes a steel substrate formed on its surface with\nan aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer in accordance with the appended claims. The aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer\ncontains Al, Zn, Si and Mg as constituent elements thereof and the Mg content is 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight. The\naluminum-zinc alloy plating layer contains 0.2% to 15% by volume of an Si-Mg phase. The weight ratio of Mg in the Si-\nMg phase to the total weight of Mg is 3% or more.\n[0015]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer is preferred to\ninclude less than 60% by weight of Mg in any region having a size of 4 mm in diameter and a depth of 50 nm in the\noutermost layer of the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer having a depth of 50 nm.\n[0016]Namely, no matter what region having a size of 4 mm in diameter and depth of 50 nm at any location in an\noutermost layer is selected, the average value of the Mg content in this region is preferably less than 60% by weight.\n[0017]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer further contains\n0.02% to 1.0% by weight of Cr as a constituent element thereof.\n[0018]Preferably, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer has the outermost layer of 50 nm depth in which 100 ppm to\n500 ppm by weight of Cr is contained.\n[0019]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, an alloy layer containing Al and Cr is preferably\ninterposed between the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer and the steel substrate. The alloy layer has a weight proportion\nof Cr which gives a ratio of 2 to 5 relative to a weight proportion of Cr in the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer.\n[0020]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, preferably, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer\ncontains the Si-Mg phase in its surface at a surface area ratio of 30% or less.\n[0021]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer contains 25%\nto 75% by weight of Al, and 0.5% to 10% by weight, based on Al, of Si. The weight ratio of Si to Mg is between 100:50\nand 100:300.\n[0022]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer is preferred to\nfurther contain 1 ppm to 1000 ppm by weight of Sr.\n[0023]In the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer preferably\nfurther contains at least one of Ti and B within a range of 0.0005% to 0.1% by weight.\n[0024]The method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention is as defined in the appended\nclaims and comprises:\npreparing a hot-dip plating bath having an alloy composition containing,\n25% to 75% by weight of Al,\n0.1% to 10% by weight of Mg,\n0.02% to 1.0% by weight of Cr,\n0.5% to 10% by weight, based on Al, of Si,\n1 ppm to 1000 ppm by weight of Sr,\n0.1% to 1.0% by weight of Fe,\nthe remainder being Zn, and\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nSi being contained at a weight ratio of 100:50 to 100:300 relative to Mg;\npassing a steel substrate through this hot-dip plating bath to deposit a hot-dip plating metal on the surface\nthereof; and\nsolidifying the hot-dip plating metal to form an aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer on the surface of the steel\nsubstrate.\n[0025]In the method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the hot-dip plating bath\npreferably further contains 100 ppm to 5000 ppm by weight of Ca.\n[0026]In the method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the hot-dip plating bath\npreferably further contains at least one of Ti and B within a range of 0.0005% to 0.1% by weight.\n[0027]In the method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the hot-dip plating bath is\nmaintained at a temperature not exceeding by 40°C above a solidification starting temperature of the alloy composition.\n[0028]In the method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention, the steel substrate is\npreferably transferred from the hot-dip plating bath to a non-oxidative atmosphere or low oxidative atmosphere, after\nwhich a gas wiping process is made to adjust an amount of the hot-dip plating metal deposited on the steel substrate\nin the non-oxidative atmosphere or low oxidative atmosphere before the hot-dip plating metal is solidified.\n[0029]The method of producing the hot-dipped steel according to the present invention preferably includes a step of\nholding the steel substrate coated with the aluminum-zinc alloy plating layer, at a holding temperature t (°C) for a holding\ntime y (hr) defined by the following formula (1). \n(where 150 ≤ 250)\nADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION\n[0030]According to the present invention, the hot-dipped steel is obtained that demonstrates favorable corrosion\nresistance and a favorable appearance for the surface of the plating layer by inhibiting the formation of wrinkles therein.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0031]\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing an example of a hot-dip plating equipment in an embodiment of the present\ninvention;\nFIG. 2 is a partial schematic diagram showing another example of a hot-dip plating equipment;\nFIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing an example of a heating apparatus and an insulating container used for\noveraging treatment in an embodiment of the present invention;\nFIG. 4(a) is an image obtained by photographing a cross-sectional surface of hot-dipped sheet steel obtained\nExample 5 with an electron microscope, and FIG. 4 (b) is a graph indicating the results of elemental analysis of an\nSi-Mg phase in Example 5;\nFIG. 5 (a) is a graph indicating the results of analyzing the direction of plating layer depth with a glow discharge\noptical emission spectrometer for Example 5, and FIG. 5(b) indicates the results for Example 44;\nFIG. 6 is an image obtained by photographing the surface of a plating layer in hot-dipped sheet steel obtained in\nExample 5 with an electron microscope;\nFIG. 7(a) shows a photograph of the appearance of a plating layer for Example 5, and FIG. 7(b) shows the same\nfor Example 9;\nFIG. 8 (a) shows a photograph obtained with a light microscope of the appearance of a plating layer for Example\n56, and FIG. 8 (b) shows the same for Example 5;\nFIG. 9 shows a photograph of the appearance of a plating layer for Example 44; and\nFIG. 10 is a graph indicating the results of evaluating overaging treatment for a hot-dipped sheet steel of Example 5.\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0032]The following provides an explanation of embodiments of the present invention.\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[Hot-Dipped Steel]\n[0033]The hot-dipped steel according to the present embodiment is obtained by forming an aluminum-zinc alloy plating\nlayer (to be referred to as the plating layer) onto the surface of a steel substrate 1. Examples of the steel substrate 1\ninclude various members such as thin sheet steel, thick sheet steel, die steel, steep pipe or steel wire. In other words,\nthere are no particular limitations on the form of the steel substrate 1. The plating layer is formed by hot-dipping treatment.\n[0034]The plating layer contains Al, Zn, Si and Mg as constituent elements thereof. The Mg content of the plating\nlayer is 0.1% to 10% by weight. Consequently, in addition to corrosion resistance of the surface of the plating layer being\nimproved by Al, due to sacrificial corrosion protective action by Zn, edge creep is inhibited on cut ends of the hot-dipped\nsteel, thereby imparting a high level of corrosion resistance to the hot-dipped steel. Moreover, excessive alloying between\nthe Al and steel substrate is inhibited by Si, thereby preventing an alloy layer (to be subsequently described) interposed\nbetween the plating layer and the steel substrate from impairing workability of the hot-dipped steel. Moreover, as a result\nof the plating layer containing Mg, which is a less noble metal than Zn, the sacrificial corrosion preventive action of the\nplating layer is enhanced, thereby further improving the corrosion resistance of the hot-dipped steel.\n[0035]The plating layer contains 0.2% to 15% by volume of an Si-Mg phase. The Si-Mg phase is a phase composed\nof an intermetallic compound of Si and Mg, and is dispersed in the plating layer.\n[0036]The volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer is equal to the percent area of the Si-Mg phase\nin a cross-section in the case of cutting the plating layer in the direction of thickness thereof. The Si-Mg phase in a cross-\nsection of the plating layer can be clearly confirmed by observing with an electron microscope. Consequently, the volume\npercentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer can be measured indirectly by measuring the percent area of the Si-\nMg phase in a cross-section.\n[0037]The formation of wrinkles in the plating layer is inhibited to a greater degree the higher the volume percentage\nof the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer. This is thought to be due to the Si-Mg phase precipitating in the hot-dip plating\nmetal before the hot-dip plating metal completely solidifies, and this Si-Mg phase inhibiting flow of the hot-dip plating\nmetal in a process by which the plating layer is formed as a result of the hot-dip plating metal being cooled during\nproduction of a hot-dipped steel. The volume percentage of this Si-Mg phase is more preferably 0.1% to 20%, even\nmore preferably 0.2% to 10% and particularly preferably 0.4% to 5%.\n[0038]The plating layer is composed of the Si-Mg phase and another phase containing Zn and Al. The phase containing\nZn and Al is mainly composed of an α-Al phase (dendritic structure) and a Zn-Al-Mg eutectic phase (interdendritic\nstructure). The phase that contains Zn and Al can further contain various types of phases such as a phase composed\nof Mg-Zn\n2\n (Mg-Zn\n2\n phase), phase composed of Si (Si phase) or phase composed of an Fe-Al intermetallic compound\n(Fe-Al phase) corresponding to the composition of the plating layer. The phase that contains Zn and Al constitutes the\nportion of the plating layer remaining after excluding the Si-Mg phase. Thus, the volume percentage of the phase that\ncontains Zn and Al in the plating layer is within the range of 99.9% to 60%, preferably within the range of 99.9% to 80%,\nmore preferably within the range of 99.8% to 90%, and particularly preferably within the range of 99.6% to 95%.\n[0039]The weight ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total weight of Mg in the plating layer is 1% by weight\nor more. Mg not contained in the Si-Mg phase is contained in the phase that contains Zn and Al. In the phase that\ncontains Zn and Al, Mg is contained in, for example, an α-Al phase, Zn-Al-Mg eutectic phase, Mg-Zn\n2\n phase or Mg-\ncontaining oxide film formed on the plating surface. The Mg is in solid solution in the α-Al phase in the case it is contained\nin an α-Al phase.\n[0040]The weight ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total weight of Mg in the plating layer can be calculated\nby considering the Si-Mg phase to have the stoichiometric composition of Mg\n2\nSi. Furthermore, although the composite\nratios of Si and Mg in the Si-Mg phase may actually vary slightly from the stoichiometric composition since there is the\npossibility of the Si-Mg phase containing small amounts of elements other than Si and Mg such as Al, Zn, Cr or Fe, it is\nextremely difficult to precisely determine the amount of Mg in the Si-Mg phase when these are taken into consideration.\nConsequently, in the present invention, when determining the weight ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total\nweight of Mg in the plating layer, the Si-Mg phase is considered to have the stoichiometric composition of Mg\n2\nSi as\npreviously described.\n[0041]The weight ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total weight of Mg in the plating layer can be calculated\naccording to the following formula (1).\n[0042]R represents the weight ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total weight of Mg in the plating layer\n(wt%), A represents the Mg content contained in the Si-Mg phase of the plating layer per unit surface area as viewed\noverhead of the plating layer (g/m\n2\n), M represents the weight of the plating layer per unit surface area as viewed overhead\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nof the plating layer (g/m\n2\n), and CMG represents the total content of Mg in the plating layer (wt%).\n[0043]A can be calculated from the following formula (2).\n[0044]V\n2\n represents the volume of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer per unit surface area as viewed overhead of\nthe plating layer (m\n3\n/m\n2\n). ρ\n2\n represents the density of the Si-Mg phase, and the value thereof is 1.94 3 10\n6\n (g/m\n3\n). α\nrepresents the weight ratio of Mg contained in the Si-Mg phase, and the value thereof is 0.63.\n[0045]V\n2\n can be calculated from the following formula (3).\n[0046]V\n1\n represents the total volume of the plating layer per unit surface area as viewed overhead of the plating layer\n(m\n3\n/m\n2\n), and R\n2\n represents the volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer (vol%).\n[0047]V\n1\n can be calculated from the following formula (4).\nρ\n1\n represents the density of the entire plating layer (g/m\n3\n). The value of ρ\n1\n can be calculated by weighted averaging\ndensity of the constituent elements of the plating layer at normal temperature based on the composition of the plating layer.\n[0048]In the present embodiment, Mg in the plating layer is contained in the Si-Mg phase at a high ratio as previously\ndescribed. Consequently, the amount of Mg present in the surface layer of the plating layer decreases, and the formation\nof an Mg-based oxide film in the surface layer of the plating layer is inhibited as a result thereof. Thus, wrinkling of the\nplating layer caused by the Mg-based oxide film is inhibited. The formation of wrinkles is inhibited to a greater degree\nthe higher the percentage of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total amount of Mg. This percentage is more preferably\n5% by weight or more, even more preferably 20% by weight or more, and particularly preferably 50% by weight or more.\nThere are no particular limitations on the upper limit of the percentage of Mg in the Si-Mg phase based on the total\namount of Mg, and this percentage may be 100% by weight.\n[0049]Mg content in any region having a size of 4 mm in diameter and a depth of 50 nm in the outermost layer of the\nplating layer having a depth of 50 nm is preferably less than 60% by weight. Mg content in this outermost layer of the\nplating layer is measured by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES).\n[0050]Wrinkling caused by an Mg-based oxide film is inhibited to a greater degree the lower the Mg content in the\noutermost layer of the plating layer. This Mg content is preferably less than 40% by weight, more preferably less than\n20% by weight, and particularly preferably less than 10% by weight.\n[0051]Preferably, the plating layer contains the Si-Mg phase in its surface at a surface area ratio of 30% or less. When\nthe Si-Mg phase is present in the plating layer, the Si-Mg phase easily becomes thin and is formed in the form of a mesh\non the surface of the plating layer, and the appearance of the plating layer changes if the area ratio of the Si-Mg phase\nis large. In the case the distribution of the Si-Mg phase on the plating surface is uneven, visual differences in luster are\nobserved in the appearance of the plating layer. This uneven luster constitutes an appearance defect referred to as\nrunning. If the plating layer contains the Si-Mg phase in its surface at a surface area ratio of 30% or less, running is\ninhibited and the appearance of the plating layer improves. Moreover, a low area ratio of the Si-Mg phase on the surface\nof the plating layer is also effective for maintaining corrosion resistance of the plating layer over a long period of time.\nIf precipitation of the Si-Mg phase onto the surface of the plating layer is inhibited, the amount of the Si-Mg phase that\nprecipitates inside the plating layer increases relative thereto. Consequently, the amount of Mg inside the plating layer\nincreases, the sacrificial corrosion preventive action of Mg is demonstrated in the plating layer over a long period of time\nas a result thereof, and the corrosion resistance of the plating layer is therefore maintained over a long period of time.\nIn order to improve the appearance of the plating layer and maintain corrosion resistance over a long period of time, the\nplating layer contains the Si-Mg phase in its surface at a surface area ratio of preferably 20% or less, more preferably\n10% or less and particularly preferably 5% or less.\n[0052]The content of Mg in the plating layer is within the range of 0.1% to 10% by weight as previously described. If\nthe Mg content is less than 0.1% by weight, corrosion resistance of the plating layer is no longer adequately ensured.\nIf the content exceeds 10% by weight, not only does the action of improving corrosion resistance become saturated, but\ndross easily forms in the hot-dip plating bath during production of hot-dipped steel. This Mg content is more preferably\n0.5% by weight or more and even more preferably 1.0% by weight or more. In addition, this Mg content is preferably\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n5.0% by weight or less and more preferably 3.0% by weight or less. Mg content is particularly preferably within the range\nof 1.0% to 3.0% by weight.\n[0053]The Al content in the plating layer is within the range of 25% to 75% by weight. If the Al content is 25% by\nweight or more, the Zn content in the plating layer does not become excessive, and corrosion is adequately ensured on\nthe surface of the plating layer. If the Al content is 75% by weight or less, sacrificial corrosion preventive effects of Zn\nare adequately demonstrated, hardening of the plating layer is inhibited, and bending workability of the hot-dippedsteel\nis increased. Moreover, the Al content is also preferably 75% by weight or less from the viewpoint of further inhibiting\nwrinkling of the plating layer by preventing fluidity of the hot-dip plating metal from becoming excessively low during\nproduction of the hot-dipped steel. This Al content is particularly preferably 45% by weight or more. In addition, this Al\ncontent is particularly preferably 65% by weight or less. The Al content is particularly preferably within the range of 45%\nby weight to 65% by weight.\n[0054]The Si content of the plating layer is within the range of 0.5% to 10% by weight based on the Al content. If the\ncontent of Si is 0.5% by weight or more based on the Al content, excessively alloying between the Al in the plating layer\nand the steel substrate is adequately inhibited. If the Si content exceeds 10% by weight based on the Al content, not\nonly does the action of the Si become saturated, but dross easily forms in a hot-dip plating bath 2 during production of\nthe hot-dipped steel. This Si content is particularly preferably 1.0% by weight or more. In addition, this Si content is\nparticularly preferably 5.0% by weight or less. The Si content is particularly preferably within the range of 1.0% to 5.0%\nby weight.\n[0055]Moreover, the weight ratio of Si to Mg in the plating layer is between 100:50 and 100:300. In this case, the\nformation of a Si-Mg layer in the plating layer in particular is promoted and the formation of wrinkles in the plating layer\nis further inhibited. This weight ratio of Si to Mg is more preferably 100:70 to 100:250 and even more preferably 100:100\nto 100:200.\n[0056]The plating layer further contains Cr as a constituent element thereof. In this case, growth of the Si-Mg phase\nin the plating layer is promoted by Cr, the volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer increases, and the\nratio of the Mg in the Si-Mg phase to the total weight of Mg in the plating layer increases. As a result, wrinkling of the\nplating layer is further inhibited. The Cr content in the plating layer is within the range of 0.02% by weight to 1.0% by\nweight. If the Cr content in the plating layer is greater than 1.0% by weight, not only does the above-mentioned action\nbecome saturated, but dross easily forms in the hot-dip plating bath 2 during production of the hot-dipped steel. This Cr\ncontent is particularly preferably 0.05% by weight or more. In addition, this Cr content is particularly preferably 0.5% by\nweight or less. The Cr content is more preferably within the range of 0.07% by weight to 0.2% by weight.\n[0057]In the case the plating layer contains Cr, the Cr content in the outermost layer having a depth of 50 nm in the\nplating layer is preferably 100 ppm to 500 ppm by weight. In this case, the corrosion resistance of the plating layer\nimproves further. This is thought to be because, when Cr is present in the outermost layer, a passive film is formed on\nthe plating layer, and anodic dissolution of the plating layer is inhibited as a result thereof. This Cr content is more\npreferably 150 ppm to 450 ppm by weight and even more preferably 200 ppm to 400 ppm by weight.\n[0058]An alloy layer containing Al and Cr is preferably interposed between the plating layer and the steel substrate.\nIn the present invention, the alloy layer is considered to be a layer that differs from the plating layer. The alloy layer may\nalso contain various metal elements such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn or Sn other than Al and Cr as constituent elements\nthereof. When such an alloy layer is present, growth of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer is promoted by the Cr in the\nalloy layer, the volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer increases, and the ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg\nphase to the total weight of Mg in the plating layer increases. As a result, wrinkling and running of the plating layer are\nfurther inhibited. In particular, the ratio of the content ratio of Cr in the alloy layer to the content ratio of Cr in the plating\nlayer is preferably 2 to 50. In this case, the area ratio of the Si-Mg phase on the surface of the plating layer becomes\nlower as a result of growth of the Si-Mg phase being promoted near the alloy layer in the plating layer, thereby further\ninhibiting running and maintaining corrosion resistance of the plating layer over a longer period of time. The ratio of the\ncontent ratio of Cr in the alloy layer to the content ratio of Cr in the plating layer is more preferably 3 to 40 and even\nmore preferably 4 to 25. The amount of Cr in the alloy layer can be derived by measuring a cross-section of the plating\nlayer using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).\n[0059]The thickness of the alloy layer is preferably within the range of 0.05 mm to 5 mm. If this thickness is 0.05 mm\nor more, the above-mentioned action of the alloy layer is effectively demonstrated. If this thickness is 5 mm or less,\nworkability of the hot-dipped steel is less likely to be impaired by the alloy layer.\n[0060]If the plating layer contains Cr, corrosion resistance is also improved after bending and deformation of the\nplating layer. The reason for this is thought to be as described below. When the plating layer is subjected to severe\nbending and deformation, cracks may form in the plating layer and coated film thereon. At that time, water and oxygen\nend up entering the plating layer through these cracks, thereby directly exposing alloy within the plating layer to corrosive\nfactors. However, Cr present particularly in the surface layer of the plating layer and Cr present in the alloy layer inhibit\ncorrosive reactions of the plating layer, thereby inhibiting expansion of corrosion initiating from the cracks. In order to\nimprove corrosion resistance following bending and deformation of the plating layer in particular, the Cr content in the\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\noutermost layer having a depth of 50 nm in the plating layer is preferably 300 ppm by weight or more, and particularly\npreferably within the range of 200 ppm to 400 ppm by weight. In addition, in order to improve corrosion resistance\nfollowing bending and deformation of the plating layer in particular, the ratio of the content ratio of Cr in the alloy layer\nto the content ratio of Cr in the plating layer is preferably 20 or more and particularly preferably within the range of 20 to 30.\n[0061]The plating layer further contains Sr as a constituent element thereof. In this case, the formation of the Si-Mg\nphase in the plating layer is further promoted by Sr. Moreover, the formation of an Mg-based oxide film in the surface\nlayer of the plating layer is inhibited by Sr. This is thought to be the result of the formation of an Mg-based oxide film\nbeing inhibited since an Sr oxide film is preferentially formed more easily than an Mg-based oxide film. As a result, the\nformation of wrinkles in the plating layer is further inhibited. The Sr content in the plating layer is preferably within the\nrange of 1 ppm to 1000 ppm by weight. If this Sr content is less than 1 ppm by weight, the above-mentioned action is\nno longer demonstrated, while if the Sr content exceeds 1000 ppm by weight, not only does the action of Sr become\nsaturated, but dross is easily formed in the hot-dip plating bath 2 during production of the hot-dipped steel. This Sr\ncontent is particularly preferably 5 ppm by weight or more. In addition, this Sr content is particularly preferably 500 ppm\nby weight or less and even more preferably 300 ppm by weight or less. The Sr content is more preferably within the\nrange of 20 ppm to 50 ppm by weight.\n[0062]The plating layer further contains Fe as a constituent element thereof. In this case, formation of the Si-Mg phase\nin the plating layer is further promoted by Fe. Moreover, Fe also contributes to increasing the fineness of the microstructure\nand spangle structure of the plating layer, thereby improving the appearance and workability of the plating layer. The\nFe content in the plating layer is preferably within the range of 0.1% to 0.6% by weight. If this Fe content is less than\n0.1% by weight, the microstructure and spangle structure of the plating layer becomes coarse, thereby impairing the\nappearance of the plating layer while also resulting in poor workability. If the Fe content exceeds 0.6% by weight, the\nspangle structure of the plating layer becomes excessively fine or disappears, thereby eliminating any improvement of\nappearance attributable to the spangle structure while also facilitating the formation of dross in the hot-dip plating bath\n2 during production of the hot-dipped steel, thereby further impairing the appearance of the plating layer. This Fe content\nis particularly preferably 0.2% by weight or more. In addition, this Fe content is particularly preferably 0.5% by weight\nor less. The Fe content is particularly preferably within the range of 0.2% to 0.5% by weight.\n[0063]The plating layer may further contain elements selected from alkaline earth elements, Sc, Y, lanthanoid ele-\nments, Ti and B as constituent elements thereof.\n[0064]Alkaline earth elements (Be, Ca, Ba and Ra), Sc, Y and lanthanoid elements (such as La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm\nand Eu) demonstrate an action similar to that of Sr. The total content of these components in the plating layer as a weight\nratio is preferably 1.0% by weight or less.\n[0065]When at least one of Ti and B is contained in the plating layer, spangle structure increases in fineness due to\nincreased fineness of the α-Al phase (dendritic structure) of the plating layer, thereby enabling the spangle structure to\nimprove the appearance of the plating layer. Moreover, the formation of wrinkles in the plating layer is further inhibited\nby the presence of at least one of Ti and B. This thought to be due to the action of Ti and B also increasing the fineness\nof the Si-Mg phase, and this increased fineness of the Mg-Si phase effectively inhibits flow of the hot-dip plating metal\nin the process by which the hot-dip plating metal solidifies and forms the plating layer. Moreover, the concentration of\nstress in the plating layer during bending is alleviated by this increased fineness of the plating structure, thereby inhibiting\nthe formation of large cracks and further improving the bending workability of the plating layer. In order for this action to\nbe demonstrated, the total content of Ti and B in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as a weight ratio is preferably within the range\nof 0.0005% to 0.1% by weight. The total content of Ti and B is particularly preferably 0.001% by weight or more. In\naddition, the total content of Ti and B is particularly preferably 0.05% by weight or less. The total content of Ti and B is\nparticularly preferably within the range of 0.001% to 0.05% by weight.\n[0066]Zn accounts for the remainder of all constituent elements of the plating layer after excluding constituent elements\nother than Zn.\n[0067]The plating layer preferably does not contain elements other than the above-mentioned elements as constituent\nelements thereof. In particular, the plating layer preferably contains only Al, Zn, Si, Mg, Cr, Sr and Fe as constituent\nelements, or preferably contains only Al, Zn, Si, Mg, Cr, Sr and Fe, as well as elements selected from alkaline earth\nelements, Sc, Y, lanthanoid elements, Ti and B, as constituent elements thereof.\n[0068]However, although it goes without saying, the plating layer may also contain unavoidable impurities such as\nPb, Cd, Cu or Mn. The content of these unavoidable impurities is preferably as low as possible, and the total content of\nthese unavoidable impurities as a weight ratio based on the weight of the plating layer is preferably 1% by weight or less.\n[Method for Producing Hot-Dipped Steel]\n[0069]In a preferred embodiment, a hot-dip plating bath is prepared during production of a hot-dipped steel that has\na composition that coincides with the composition of constituent elements of the plating layer. Although an alloy layer\nis formed between the steel substrate and the plating layer as a result of hot-dip plating treatment, the resulting change\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nin composition is small enough to be ignored.\n[0070]In the present embodiment, a hot-dip plating bath is prepared that contains, for example, 25% to 75% by weight\nof Al, 0.5% to 10% by weight of Mg, 0.02% to 1.0% by weight of Cr, 0.5% to 10% by weight of Si based on Al, 1 ppm to\n1000 ppm by weight of Sr, 0.1% to 1.0% by weight of Fe, and Zn. Zn accounts for the remainder of all constituent\nelements of the plating layer after excluding constituent elements other than Zn. The weight ratio of Si to Mg in the hot-\ndip plating bath is preferably 100:50 to 100:300.\n[0071]The hot-dip plating bath may further contain a component selected from alkaline earth elements, Sc, Y, lanth-\nanoid elements, Ti and B. These components are contained in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as necessary. The total content\nof alkaline earth elements (Be, Ca, Ba and Ra), Sc, Y and lanthanoid elements (such as La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm and\nEu) in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as a weight ratio is preferably 1.0% or less. In the case the hot-dip plating bath 2 contains\na component composed of at least one of Ti and B, the total content of Ti and B in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as a weight\nratio is preferably within the range of 0.0005% to 0.1%.\n[0072]The hot-dip plating bath preferably does not contain components other than those described above. In particular,\nthe hot-dip plating bath preferably contains only Al, Zn, Si, Mg, Cr, Sr and Fe. The hot-dip plating bath also preferably\ncontains only Al, Zn, Si, Mg, Cr, Sr and Fe as well as elements selected from alkaline earth elements, Sc, Y, lanthanoid\nelements, Ti and B.\n[0073]For example, in preparing the hot-dip plating bath 2, Al at 25% to 75%, Cr at 0.02% to 1.0%, Si at 0.5% to 10%\nbased on Al, Mg at 0.1% to 0.5%, Fe at 0.1% to 0.6% and Sr at 1 ppm to 500 ppm are preferably contained as weight\nratios in the hot-dip plating bath 2, or elements selected from alkaline earth elements, lanthanoid elements, Ti and B\nare preferably further contained, and the remainder is preferably Zn.\n[0074]However, although it goes without saying, the hot-dip plating bath may also contain unavoidable impurities\nsuch as Pb, Cd, Cu or Mn. The content of these unavoidable impurities is preferably as low as possible, and the total\ncontent of these unavoidable impurities is preferably 1% by weight or less as a weight ratio based on the weight of the\nhot-dip plating bath.\n[0075]When hot-dip plating treatment is carried out on the steel substrate 1 using the hot-dip plating bath 2 having\nthe composition described above, in addition to corrosion resistance of the surface of the plating layer in particular being\nimproved by Al, due to sacrificial corrosion protective action by Zn, edge creep in particular is inhibited on cut ends of\nthe hot-dipped steel, thereby imparting a high level of corrosion resistance to the hot-dipped steel.\n[0076]Moreover, as a result of the plating layer containing Mg, which is a less noble metal than Zn, the sacrificial\ncorrosion preventive action of the plating layer is further enhanced, thereby further improving the corrosion resistance\nof the hot-dipped steel.\n[0077]Moreover, the plating layer formed by hot-dip plating treatment is resistant to the formation of wrinkles. In the\npast, when a molten metal (hot-dip plating metal) containing Mg was adhered to the steel substrate 1 by hot-dip plating\ntreatment, Mg easily concentrated on the surface of the hot-dip plating metal, thereby resulting in the formation of an\nMg-based oxide film, and wrinkles easily formed in the plating layer due to this Mg-based oxide film. However, when\nthe plating layer is formed by using the hot-dip plating bath 2 having the above-mentioned composition, concentration\nof Mg in the surface layer of the hot-dip plating metal adhered to the steel substrate 1 is inhibited, thereby making it\ndifficult for wrinkles to form on the surface of the plating layer even if the hot-dip plating metal flows. Moreover, since\nfluidity inside the hot-dip plating metal is reduced, flow per se of the hot-dip plating metal is inhibited, and it becomes\neven more difficult for wrinkles to form.\n[0078]Inhibition of concentration of Mg and flow of the hot-dip plating metal as described above are thought to be\nattributable to the mechanism described below.\n[0079]As the hot-dip plating metal adhered to the surface of the steel substrate 1 is cooled and solidifies, an α-Al\nphase first precipitates as primary crystals which then grow into a dendritic structure. As solidification of this Al-rich α-\nAl phase progresses in this manner, the concentrations of Mg and Si in the remaining hot-dip plating metal (namely,\nthose components of the hot-dip plating metal that have not yet solidified) gradually increase. Next, when the steel\nsubstrate 1 is cooled and its temperature decreases further, an Si-containing phase containing Si (Si-Mg phase) solidifies\nand precipitates from within the remaining hot-dip plating metal. This Si-Mg phase is a phase composed of an alloy of\nMg and Si as previously described. Precipitation and growth of this Si-Mg phase is promoted by Cr, Fe and Sr. As a\nresult of Mg in the hot-dip plating metal being incorporated into this Si-Mg phase, migration of Mg to the surface layer\nof the hot-dip plating metal is suppressed, and concentration of Mg in the surface layer of the hot-dip plating metal is\ninhibited.\n[0080]Moreover, Sr present in the hot-dip plating metal also contributes to inhibiting concentration of Mg. This is\nthought to be the result of Sr in the hot-dip plating metal being an element that is easily concentrated in the same manner\nas Mg, thereby resulting in the Sr competing to form an oxide film on the plating surface with Mg, and as a result, inhibiting\nformation of an Mg-based oxide film.\n[0081]Moreover, as a result of the Si-Mg phase solidifying and growing in the remaining hot-dip plating metal other\nthan the α-Al phase in the form of primary crystals as previously described, the hot-dip plating metal enters the state of\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n10\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nsolid-liquid mixed phase, thereby causing a decrease in fluidity of the hot-dip plating metal per se, and as a result thereof,\nformation of wrinkles on the surface of the plating layer is inhibited.\n[0082]Fe is important in terms of controlling the microstructure and spangle structure of the plating layer. Although\nthe reason for Fe having an effect on the structure of the plating layer is presently unclear, it is thought to be because\nFe alloys with Si in the hot-dip plating metal, and this alloy serves as a solidification nucleus during solidification of the\nhot-dip plating metal.\n[0083]Moreover, since Sr is a less noble element in the same manner as Mg, the sacrificial corrosion preventive\naction of the plating layer is further enhanced by Sr, and corrosion resistance of the hot-dipped steel is further improved.\nSr also demonstrates the action of inhibiting acicularization of the precipitated states of the Si phase and Si-Mg phase,\nthereby causing the Si phase and Si-Mg phase to become spherical and inhibiting the formation of cracks in the plating\nlayer.\n[0084]An alloy layer containing Al in a portion thereof is formed in the hot-dip plating metal between the plating layer\nand the steel substrate 1 during hot-dip plating treatment. For example, in the case pre-plating to be subsequently\ndescribed is not carried out on the steel substrate 1, an Fe-Al-based alloy layer is formed consisting mainly of Al in the\nplating bath and Fe in the steel substrate 1. In the case the pre-plating to be subsequently described is carried out on\nthe steel substrate 1, an alloy layer is formed that contains Al of the plating bath and all or a portion of the constituent\nelements of pre-plating, or further contains Fe in the steel substrate 1.\n[0085]In the case the plating bath contains Cr, the alloy layer further contains Cr in addition to Al. The alloy layer can\ncontain various metal elements such as Si, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn or Sn in addition to Al and Cr as constituent elements\nthereof corresponding to such factors as the composition of the plating bath, the presence or absence of pre-plating, or\nthe composition of the steel substrate 1.\n[0086]A portion of the Cr in the hot-dip plating metal is contained in the alloy layer at a higher concentration than in\nthe plating layer. When such an alloy layer is formed, growth of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer is promoted by Cr\nin the alloy layer, which in addition to increasing the volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer, increases\nthe ratio of Mg in the Si-Mg phase to the total weight of Mg in the plating layer. As a result, wrinkling of the plating layer\nis further inhibited. Moreover, as a result of formation of the alloy layer, corrosion resistance of the hot-dipped steel is\nfurther improved. Namely, as a result of growth of the Si-Mg phase being promoted near the alloy layer within the plating\nlayer, the area ratio of the Si-Mg phase on the surface of the plating layer decreases, and as a result, running in the\nplating layer is inhibited and corrosion resistance of the plating layer is maintained over a long period of time. In particular,\nthe ratio of the content ratio of Cr in the alloy layer to the content ratio of Cr in the plating layer is preferably 2 to 50. This\nratio of the content ratio of Cr in the alloy layer to the content ratio of Cr in the plating layer is more preferably 3 to 40\nand even more preferably 4 to 25. The amount of Cr in the alloy layer can be derived by measuring a cross-section of\nthe plating layer using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).\n[0087]Although workability of the hot-dipped steel decreases if the alloy layer is excessively thick, excessive growth\nof the alloy layer is inhibited by the action of Si in the hot-dip plating bath 2, and consequently, favorable workability of\nthe hot-dipped steel is ensured. The thickness of the alloy layer is preferably within the range of 0.05 mm to 5 mm. If the\nthickness of the alloy layer is within this range, corrosion resistance of the hot-dipped steel is adequately improved and\nworkability is also adequately improved.\n[0088]1 Moreover, corrosion resistance of the plating layer is further improved accompanying the concentration of Cr\nnear the surface thereof being maintained within a fixed range in the plating layer. Although the reason for this is unclear,\nit is presumed that this is the result of the formation of a complex oxide film near the surface of the plating layer due to\nCr bonding with oxygen. In order to improve corrosion resistance of the plating layer in this manner, the content of Cr\nin the outermost layer having a depth of 50 nm in the plating layer is preferably 100 ppm by weight to 500 ppm by weight.\n[0089]If the hot-dip plating bath contains Cr, corrosion resistance is also improved after bending and deformation of\nthe plating layer. The reason for this is thought to be as described below. When the plating layer is subjected to severe\nbending and deformation, cracks may form in the plating layer and coated film thereon. At that time, water and oxygen\nend up entering the plating layer through these cracks, thereby directly exposing alloy within the plating layer to corrosive\nfactors. However, Cr present particularly in the surface layer of the plating layer and Cr present in the alloy layer inhibit\ncorrosive reactions of the plating layer, thereby inhibiting expansion of corrosion initiating from the cracks.\n[0090]The hot-dip plating metal treated in the preferred embodiment described above is multi-component molten\nmetal containing seven or more component elements, and although the solidification process thereof is extremely complex\nand difficult to predict theoretically, the inventors of the present invention obtained the above-mentioned findings through\nexperimental observations and the like.\n[0091]As a result of the composition of the hot-dip plating bath 2 being adjusted in the manner described above,\nwrinkling and running in the plating layer can be inhibited as previously described, and corrosion resistance and workability\nof hot-dipped steels can be ensured.\n[0092]If the content of Al in this hot-dip plating bath 2 is less than 25%, the content of Zn in the plating layer becomes\nexcessive and corrosion resistance on the surface of the plating layer becomes inadequate, while if the Al content\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n11\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nexceeds 75%, sacrificial corrosion preventive effects of Zn decrease, the plating layer becomes hard, and bending\nworkability of the hot-dipped sheet steel ends up decreasing. If the Al content exceeds 75%, fluidity of the hot-dip plating\nmetal ends up increasing, resulting in the risk of triggering the formation of wrinkles in the plating layer. The Al content\nis particularly preferably 45% or more. In addition, the Al content is particularly preferably 65% or less. The Al content\nis particularly preferably within the range of 45% to 65%.\n[0093]If the Cr content in the hot-dip plating bath 2 is less than 0.02%, in addition to it being difficult to adequately\nensure corrosion resistance of the plating layer, it also becomes difficult to adequately inhibit wrinkling and running of\nthe plating layer, while if the content of Cr exceeds 1.0%, not only does the action of improving corrosion resistance of\nthe plating layer become saturated, but dross easily forms in the hot-dip plating bath 2. This Cr content is particularly\npreferably 0.05% or more. In addition, this Cr content is particularly preferably 0.5% or less. The Cr content is more\npreferably within the range of 0.07% to 0.2%.\n[0094]The above-mentioned action is no longer demonstrated if the content of Si in the hot-dip plating bath 2 based\non Al is less than 0.5%, and if the content exceeds 10%, not only does the action of Si become saturated, but dross\neasily forms in the hot-dip plating bath 2. This Si content is particularly preferably 1.0% or more. In addition, this Si\ncontent is particularly preferably 5.0% or less. The Si content is more preferably within the range of 1.0% to 5.0%.\n[0095]If the content of Mg in the hot-dip plating bath 2 is less than 0.1%, corrosion resistance of the plating layer is\nnot adequately ensured, while if the content exceeds 10%, not only does the action of improving corrosion resistance\nbecome saturated, but dross easily formed in the hot-dip plating bath 2. This Mg content is more preferably 0.5% or\nmore and even more preferably 1.0% or more. In addition, this Mg content is particularly preferably 5.0% or less and\nmore preferably 3.0% or less. The Mg content is particularly preferably within the range of 1.0% to 3.0%.\n[0096]If the content of Fe in the hot-dip plating bath 2 is less than 0.1%, the microstructure and spangle structure of\nthe plating layer becomes coarse, which together with impairing the appearance of the plating layer, while also resulting\nin the risk of poor workability, while if the content of Fe exceeds 0.6%, the spangle structure of the plating layer becomes\nexcessively fine or disappears, thereby eliminating any improvement of appearance attributable to the spangle structure\nwhile also facilitating the formation of dross in the hot-dip plating bath 2. This Fe content is particularly preferably 0.2%\nor more. This Fe content is particularly preferably 0.5% or less. The Fe content is particularly preferably within the range\nof 0.2% to 0.5%.\n[0097]If the content of Sr in the hot-dip plating bath 2 is less than 1 ppm, the above-mentioned action is no longer\ndemonstrated, while if the content exceeds 500 ppm, not only does the action of Sr become saturated, but dross easily\nforms in the hot-dip plating bath 2. The Sr content is particularly preferably 5 ppm or more. The Sr content is particularly\npreferably 300 ppm or less. The Sr content is more preferably within the range of 20 ppm to 50 ppm.\n[0098]In the case the hot-dip plating bath 2 contains a component selected from alkaline earth elements and lanthanoid\nelements, the alkaline earth elements (Be, Ca, Ba and Ra), Sc, Y and lanthanoid elements (such as La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm,\nSm or Eu) demonstrate the same action as Sr. The total content of these components in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as a\nweight ratio is preferably 1.0% or less as previously described.\n[0099]In the case the hot-dip plating bath 2 contains Ca in particular, the formation of dross in the hot-dip plating bath\nis inhibited considerably. In the case the hot-dip plating bath contains Mg, although it is difficult to avoid a certain degree\nof the formation of dross even if the Mg content is 10% by weight or less, and it is necessary to remove the dross from\nthe plating bath in order to ensure a favorable appearance of hot-dipped steels, if Ca is further contained in the hot-dip\nplating bath, dross formation attributable to Mg is inhibited considerably. As a result, in addition to further inhibiting\nimpairment of the appearance of the hot-dipped steel by dross, the bother associated with having to remove dross from\nthe hot-dip plating bath is reduced. The content of Ca in the hot-dip plating bath 2 is preferably within the range of 100\nppm to 5000 ppm by weight. If the content is 100 ppm by weight or more, formation of dross in the hot-dip plating bath\nis effectively inhibited. If the Ca content is in excess, although there is the risk of the Ca causing the formation of dross,\nby making the Ca content to be 500 ppm by weight or less, dross formation attributable to Ca is inhibited. The Ca content\nis more preferably within the range of 200 ppm to 1000 ppm by weight.\n[0100]If at least one of Ti and B is contained in the hot-dip plating bath 2, the spangle structure of the plating layer\nincreases in fineness due to increased fineness of the α-Al phase (dendritic structure) of the plating layer, thereby\nenabling the spangle structure to improve the appearance of the plating layer. Moreover, the formation of wrinkles in\nthe plating layer is further inhibited. This thought to be due to the action of Ti and B also increasing the fineness of the\nSi-Mg phase, and this increased fineness of the Si-Mg phase effectively inhibits flow of the hot-dip plating metal in the\nprocess by which the hot-dip plating metal solidifies and forms the plating layer. Moreover, the concentration of stress\nin the plating layer during bending is alleviated by this increased fineness of the plating structure, thereby inhibiting the\nformation of large cracks and further improving the bending workability. In order for this action to be demonstrated, the\ntotal content of Ti and B in the hot-dip plating bath 2 as a weight ratio is preferably within the range of 0.0005% to 0.1%.\nThe total content of Ti and B is particularly preferably 0.001% or more. The total content of Ti and B is particularly\npreferably 0.05% or less. The total content of Ti and B is particularly preferably within the range of 0.001% to 0.05%.\n[0101]The plating layer is formed by hot-dip plating treatment using this hot-dip plating bath 2. In this plating layer,\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n12\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nconcentration of Mg in the surface layer is inhibited as previously described. As a result, Mg content in any region having\na size of 4 mm in diameter and a depth of 50 nm in the outermost layer of the plating layer having a depth of 50 nm is\npreferably less than 60% by weight. In this case, the amount of Mg-based oxide film on the outermost layer of the plating\nlayer becomes particularly low, and wrinkling caused by the Mg-based oxide film is further inhibited. Wrinkling caused\nby the Mg-based oxide film is more greatly inhibited the lower the Mg content in the outermost layer. This Mg content\nis more preferably less than 40% by weight, even more preferably less than 20% by weight, and particularly preferably\nless than 10% by weight. There are preferably no portions in the outermost layer of the plating layer having a thickness\nof 50 nm where the Mg content is 60% by weight or more, more preferably no portions where the Mg content is 40% by\nweight or more, and even more preferably no portions where the Mg content is 20% by weight or more.\n[0102]The following provides an explanation of the physical significance of the Mg content. The content of Mg in an\nMgO oxide having a stoichiometric composition is about 60% by weight. Namely, an Mg content of less than 60% by\nweight means that MgO having a stoichiometric composition (oxide film consisting of MgO only) is not present in the\noutermost layer of the plating layer, or the formation of this MgO having a stoichiometric composition is extremely\ninhibited. In the present embodiment, as a result of inhibiting excessive oxidation of Mg in the outermost layer of the\nplating layer, the formation of an oxide film composed of MgO alone is inhibited. Complex oxides containing small or\nlarge amounts of oxides of elements other than Mg such as Al, Zn or Sr are formed in the outermost layer of the plating\nlayer, and consequently, the content of Mg in the surface layer of the plating layer is thought to decrease relative thereto.\n[0103]The Mg content in the outermost layer of the plating layer can be analyzed using a glow discharge optical\nemission spectrometer. In the case it is difficult to obtain accurate values for quantitative analysis of concentration, the\nabsence of an oxide film of MgO alone in the outermost layer of the plating layer may be confirmed by comparing\nconcentration curves of each of the plurality of elements contained in the plating layer.\n[0104]The volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer is preferably within the range of 0.2% to 15%\nby volume. The volume percentage of this Si-Mg phase is more preferably 0.2% to 10%, even more preferably 0.3% to\n8% and particularly preferably 0.4% to 5%. The presence of the Si-Mg phase in the plating layer in this manner enables\nMg to be adequately incorporated in the Si-Mg phase during formation of the plating layer while also causing the flow\nof the hot-dip plating metal to be inhibited by the Si-Mg phase, thereby further inhibiting the formation of wrinkles in the\nplating layer.\n[0105]In the hot-dipped steel, protrusions having height of greater than 200 mm and steepness greater than 1.0 are\npreferably no longer present on the surface of the plating layer in particular as a result of wrinkling of the surface of the\nplating layer being inhibited in the manner described above. Steepness refers to a value defined by the expression\n(protrusion height (mm))/(protrusion bottom width (mm)). The bottom of a protrusion refers to the location where the\nprotrusion intersects a virtual plane containing a flat surface surrounding the protrusion. The height of a protrusion refers\nto the height from the bottom of the protrusion to the tip of the protrusion. In the case of low steepness, the appearance\nof the plating surface is further improved. Moreover, in the case a chemical conversion treatment layer or coating layer\nis formed on the plating layer as will be subsequently described, in addition to the protrusions being prevented from\npenetrating through the chemical conversion treatment layer or coating layer, the thickness of the chemical conversion\ntreatment layer or coating layer is able to easily be made uniform. As a result, in addition to improving the appearance\nof the hot-dipped steel on which a chemical conversion treatment layer or coating layer is formed, the hot-dipped steel\nis able to demonstrate even more superior corrosion resistance and the like due to the chemical conversion treatment\nlayer or coating layer.\n[0106]Adjustment of the degree of concentration of Mg, status of the Si-Mg phase, thickness of the alloy layer and\nsteepness of protrusions on the surface of the plating layer can be achieved by carrying out hot-dip plating treatment\non the steel substrate 1 using the hot-dip plating bath 2 having the above-mentioned composition.\n[0107]In carrying out hot-dip plating treatment, hot-dip plating treatment for forming a plating layer may be carried out\non the steel substrate 1 on which is formed a pre-plating layer containing at least one component selected from Cr, Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Sn. The pre-plating layer is formed on the surface of the steel substrate 1 by carrying out pre-\nplating treatment on the steel substrate 1 before carrying out the hot-dip plating treatment. Due to the presence of this\npre-plating layer, wettability between the steel substrate 1 and hot-dip plating metal during hot-dip plating treatment\nincreases, and adhesion between the steel substrate 1 and the plating layer improves.\n[0108]Although dependent on the type of metal that composes the pre-plating layer, the pre-plating layer contributes\nto further improvement of surface appearance and corrosion resistance of the plating layer. For example, in the case a\npre-plating layer is formed that contains Cr, the formation of an alloy layer containing Cr is promoted between the steel\nsubstrate 1 and the plating layer, thereby further improving corrosion resistance of the hot-dipped steel. For example,\nin the case a pre-plating layer is formed that contains Fe and Ni, wettability between the steel substrate 1 and the hot-\ndip plating metal increases, adhesion of the plating layer improves considerably, precipitation of the Si-Mg phase is\nfurther promoted, and the appearance of the surface of the plating layer is further improved. Promotion of precipitation\nof the Si-Mg phase is also thought to occur due to a reaction between the pre-plating layer and the hot-dip plating metal.\n[0109]Although there are no particular limitations on the adhered amount of the pre-plating layer, the amount adhered\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n13\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nto one side of the steel substrate 1 is preferably within the range of 0.1 g/m\n2\n to 3 g/m\n2\n. If the adhered amount is less\nthan 0.1 g/m\n2\n, it becomes difficult to cover the surface of the steel substrate with the pre-plating layer, and ameliorative\neffects are not adequately demonstrated by the pre-plating layer. In addition, in the case the adhered amount exceeds\n3 g/m\n2\n, ameliorative effects become saturated and production cost increases.\n[0110]The following provides an overview of a hot-dip plating equipment for carrying out hot-dip plating treatment on\nthe steel substrate 1 and an explanation of optimum treatment conditions for hot-dip plating treatment.\n[0111]The steel substrate 1 targeted for treatment is a member formed from steel such as alloy steel, stainless steel,\nnickel chrome steel, nickel chrome molybdenum steel, chrome steel, chrome molybdenum steel or manganese steel.\nExamples of the steel substrate 1 include various members such as thin sheet steel, thick sheet steel, die steel, steep\npipe or steel wire. In other words, there are no particular limitations on the form of the steel substrate 1.\n[0112]Flux treatment may be carried out on the steel substrate 1 prior to hot-dip plating treatment. This flux treatment\nmakes it possible to improve wettability and adhesion between the steel substrate 1 and the hot-dip plating bath 2. The\nsteel substrate 1 may also be subjected to thermal annealing and reduction treatment prior to being immersed in the\nhot-dip plating bath 2 or this treatment may be omitted. Pre-plating treatment may also be carried out on the steel\nsubstrate 1 prior to hot-dip plating treatment as previously described.\n[0113]The following provides an explanation of the production process of the hot-dipped steel (hot-dipped sheet steel)\nin the case of employing a sheet substrate (sheet steel 1a) for the steel substrate 1, namely in the case of producing a\nhot-dipped sheet steel.\n[0114]The hot-dip plating equipment shown in FIG. 1 is provided with a transport device that continuously transports\nthe sheet steel 1a. This transport device is composed of a feeder 3, a winder 12 and a plurality of transport rollers 15.\nIn this transport device, a coil 13 of a long sheet steel 1a (a first coil 13) is held by the feeder 3. This first coil 13 is\nunwound with the feeder 3, and the sheet steel 1a is transported to the winder 12 while being supported by the transport\nrollers 15. Moreover, the sheet steel 1a is wound by the winder 12 and this winder 12 holds a coil 14 (a second coil 14)\nof the sheet steel 1a.\n[0115]In this hot-dip plating equipment, a heating furnace 4, an annealing/cooling unit 5, a snout 6, a pot 7, spray\nnozzles 9, a cooling device 10 and a temper rolling/shape correcting device 11 are sequentially provided moving in order\nfrom the upstream side of the transport route of the sheet steel 1a used by the transport device. The heating furnace 4\nheats the sheet steel 1a. This heating furnace 4 is composed of an oxidation-free furnace or the like. The annealing/cooling\nunit 5 thermally anneals the sheet steel 1a followed by cooling thereof. This annealing/cooling unit 5 is connected to the\nheating furnace 4, and an annealing furnace is provided on the upstream side while a cooling zone (cooler) is provided\non the upstream side. A reducing atmosphere is maintained within the annealing/cooling unit 5. The snout 6 is a tubular\nmember through which the sheet steel 1a is transported, with one end thereof being connected to the annealing/cooling\nunit 5, and the other end located in the hot-dip plating bath 2 within the pot 7. A reducing atmosphere is maintained\nwithin the snout 6 in the same manner as within the annealing/cooling unit 5. The pot 7 is a container for retaining the\nhot-dip plating bath 2, and a sync roll 8 is arranged therein. The spray nozzles 9 spray a gas towards the sheet steel\n1a. The spray nozzles 9 are arranged above the pot 7. These spray nozzles 9 are arranged at locations that allow them\nto spray a gas towards both sides of the sheet steel 1a that has been lifted up from the pot 7. The cooling device 10\ncools hot-dip plating metal adhered to the sheet steel. Examples of the cooling device 10 include an air cooler and mist\ncooler, and the sheet steel 1a is cooled with this cooling device 10. The temper rolling/shape correcting device 11 carries\nout temper rolling and shape correction on the sheet steel 1a on which a plating layer has been formed. The temper\nrolling/shape correcting device 11 is provided with a skin pass mill or the like for carrying out temper rolling on the sheet\nsteel 1a, and a tension leveler or the like for carrying out shape correction on the sheet steel 1a after temper rolling.\n[0116]In the case of hot-dip plating treatment using this hot-dip plating equipment, the sheet steel 1a is continuously\nfed by first unwinding from the feeder 3. After this sheet steel 1a has been heated in the heating furnace 4, it is transported\nto the annealing/cooling unit 5 having a reducing atmosphere, and simultaneous to being annealed in an annealing\nfurnace, the surface of the sheet steel 1a is cleaned by removing rolling oil adhered to the surface thereof and removing\nany oxide films by reduction, followed by being cooled in the cooling zone. Next, the sheet steel 1a passes through the\nsnout 6 and then enters the pot 7 where it is immersed in the hot-dip plating bath 2. As a result of being supported by\nthe sync roll 8 in the pot 7, the direction of transport of the sheet steel 1a is changed from downward to upward after\nwhich it is pulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2. As a result, a hot-dip plating metal adheres to the sheet steel 1a.\n[0117]Next, the amount of hot-dip plating metal adhered to the sheet steel 1a is adjusted by spraying gas onto both\nsides of the sheet steel 1a from the spray nozzles 9. This method of adjusting the adhered amount of hot-dip plating\nmetal by spraying a gas is referred to as gas wiping. The adhered amount of hot-dip plating metal is preferably adjusted\nto within the range of 40 g/m\n2\n to 200 g/m\n2\n for both sides of the sheet steel 1a combined.\n[0118]Examples of types of gases (wiping gas) sprayed onto the sheet steel 1a during gas wiping include air, nitrogen,\nargon, helium and steam. These wiping gases may be sprayed onto the sheet steel 1a after being preheated. In the\npresent embodiment, surface oxidation and concentration of Mg in the hot-dip plating metal (increased oxidation and\nconcentration of Mg in the surface layer of the hot-dip plating metal) are essentially inhibited by using the hot-dip plating\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n14\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nbath 2 having a specific composition. Consequently, even if oxygen is contained in the wiping gas or oxygen is contained\nin the air flow incidentally generated when spraying the wiping gas, the plated amount (amount of hot-dip plating metal\nadhered to the sheet steel 1a) can be adjusted without impairing the effects of the invention.\n[0119]The method used to adjust the plated amount is not limited to the gas wiping method described above, but\nrather various methods for controlling adhered amount can be applied. Examples of methods used to control adhered\namount other than gas wiping include a roller squeezing method consisting of passing the sheet steel 1a between a pair\nof rollers arranged directly above the bath surface of the hot-dip plating bath 2, a wiping method consisting of arranging\na wiping plate in close proximity to the sheet steel 1a pulled out of the hot-dip plating bath 2 and wiping off hot-dip plating\nmetal with this wiping plate, an electromagnetic wiping method consisting of applying force that causes hot-dip plating\nmetal adhered to the sheet steel 1a to move downward by using electromagnetic force, and an adjustment method\nconsisting of adjusting the plated amount by allowing the hot-dip plating metal to move downward using the natural force\nof gravity instead of applying an external force. Two or more types of these plated amount adjustment methods may\nalso be used in combination.\n[0120]Next, the sheet steel 1a is transported further upward beyond the location of the spray nozzles 9, and then, it\nis transported so as to be turned back downward by being supported by two transport rollers 15. In other words, the\nsheet steel 1a is transported over a route in the shape of an inverted letter \"U\". In this inverted U-shaped route, the sheet\nsteel 1a is cooled by air cooling, mist cooling or the like in the cooling device 10. As a result, hot-dip plating metal adhered\nto the surface of the sheet steel 1a is solidified resulting in the formation of a plating layer.\n[0121]In order to ensure complete solidification of the hot-dip plating metal as a result of being cooled by the cooling\ndevice 10, the sheet steel 1a is preferably cooled by the cooling device 10 so that the surface temperature of the hot-\ndip plating metal (or plating layer) on the sheet steel 1a is 300°C or lower. The surface temperature of the hot-dip plating\nmetal is measured with, for example, a radiation thermometer. In order to ensure that the plating layer is formed in this\nmanner, the cooling rate from the time the sheet steel 1a is pulled out of the hot-dip plating bath 2 to the time the surface\nof the hot-dip plating metal on the sheet steel 1a reaches 300°C is preferably within the range of 5°C/sec to 100°C/sec.\nIn order to control the cooling rate of the sheet steel 1a, the cooling device 10 is preferably provided with a temperature\ncontrol function for adjusting the temperature of the sheet steel 1a along the direction of transport and the direction of\nsheet width. The cooling device 10 may be provided as a plurality of cooling devices along the direction of transport of\nthe sheet steel 1a. In FIG. 1, primary cooling devices 101, which cool the sheet steel 1a, and secondary cooling devices\n102, which cool the sheet steel 1a at a location downstream from the primary cooling devices 101, are provided in a\nroute over which the sheet steel 1a is transported at a location above the locations of the spray nozzles 9. The primary\ncooling devices 101 and the secondary cooling devices 102 may also be provided as a plurality of cooling devices. In\nthis case, cooling can be carried out by, for example, cooling the sheet steel 1a with the primary cooling devices 101\nuntil the temperature of the hot-dip plating metal reaches a temperature of 300°C or lower, and further cooling the sheet\nsteel 1a with the secondary cooling devices 102 so that the temperature when the sheet steel 1a is introduced into the\ntemper rolling/shape correcting device 11 is 100°C or lower.\n[0122]During the course of cooling the sheet steel 1a, the cooling rate at which the surface of the hot-dip plating metal\nis cooled during the time the surface temperature of the hot-dip plating metal on the sheet steel 1a is 500°C or higher\nis preferably 50°C/sec or less. In this case, precipitation of the Si-Mg phase on the surface of the plating layer in particular\nis inhibited, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of running. Although the reason why a cooling rate in this temperature\nrange has an effect on precipitation behavior of the Si-Mg phase is currently not fully understood, since the temperature\ngradient in the direction of thickness of the hot-dip plating metal increases if the cooling rate in this temperature range\nis large, and precipitation of the Mg-Si layer is preferentially promoted on the surface of the hot-dip plating metal at a\nlower temperature, the amount of precipitation of the Si-Mg phase on the outermost surface of the plating layer is thought\nto increase as a result thereof. The cooling rate in this temperature range is more preferably 40°C/sec or less and\nparticularly preferably 35°C/sec or less.\n[0123]Shape correction is carried out after temper rolling with the temper rolling/shape correcting device 11 is carried\nout on the cooled sheet steel 1a. The rolling reduction rate of temper rolling is preferably within the range of 0.3% to\n3%. The elongation rate of the sheet steel 1a by shape correction is preferably 3% or less.\n[0124]Continuing, the sheet steel 1a is wound up with the winder 12 and the coil 14 of the sheet steel 1a is held with\nthis winder 12.\n[0125]During this hot-dip plating treatment, the temperature of the hot-dip plating bath 2 in the pot 7 is preferably\nhigher than the solidification starting temperature of the hot-dip plating bath 2 and is less than or equal to a temperature\nwhich is 40°C higher than the solidification starting temperature. The temperature of the hot-dip plating bath 2 in the pot\n7 is more preferably higher than the solidification starting temperature of the hot-dip plating bath 2 and is less than or\nequal to a temperature which is 25°C higher than the solidification starting temperature. If the upper limit of the temperature\nof the hot-dip plating bath 2 is limited in this manner, the amount of time required from the time the sheet steel 1a is\npulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2 to the time the hot-dip plating metal adhered to the sheet steel 1a solidifies is\nshortened. As a result, the time during which the hot-dip plating metal adhered to the sheet steel 1a is in a flowable state\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n15\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nis also shortened, thereby making it more difficult for wrinkles to form in the plating layer. If the temperature of the hot-\ndip plating bath 2 is less than or equal to a temperature which is 20°C higher than the solidification starting temperature\nof the hot-dip plating bath 2 in particular, the formation of wrinkles in the plating layer is greatly inhibited.\n[0126]When the sheet steel 1a is pulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2, it may be pulled out into a non-oxidative\natmosphere or low oxidative atmosphere, and adjustment of the adhered amount of hot-dip plating metal on the sheet\nsteel 1a by gas wiping may also be carried out in a non-oxidative atmosphere or low oxidative atmosphere. In order to\naccomplish this, as shown in FIG. 2, for example, the transport route upstream from the hot-dip plating bath 2 of the\nsheet steel 1 pulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2 (transport route moving upward from the hot-dip plating bath 2)\nis preferably surrounded by a hollow member 22, and the inside of the hollow member 22 is preferably filled with a non-\noxidative gas or low oxidative gas such as nitrogen gas. A non-oxidative gas or low oxidative gas refers to gas having\na lower oxygen concentration than air. The oxygen concentration of the non-oxidative or low oxidative gas is preferably\n1000 ppm or less. The atmosphere in which the non-oxidative or low oxidative gas is filled is a non-oxidative or low\noxidative atmosphere, and oxidation reactions are inhibited in this atmosphere. The spray nozzles 9 are arranged inside\nthis hollow member 22. The hollow member 22 is provided so as to surround the transport route of the sheet steel 1 as\nit moves above the hot-dip plating bath 2 from within the hot-dip plating bath 2 (upper portion of the hot-dip plating bath\n2). Moreover, gas sprayed from the spray nozzles 9 is also preferably a non-oxidative or low oxidative gas such as\nnitrogen gas. In this case, since the sheet steel 1a pulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2 is exposed to a non-oxidative\nor low oxidative atmosphere, oxidation of the hot-dip plating metal adhered to the sheet steel 1a is inhibited, making it\nmore difficult for an Mg-based oxide film to form on the surface layer of this hot-dip plating metal. Consequently, the\nformation of wrinkles in the plating layer is further inhibited. Instead of using the hollow member 22, a portion or all of\nthe hot-dip plating equipment that contains the transport route of the sheet steel 1a may be arranged in a non-oxidative\nor low oxidative atmosphere.\n[0127]Overaging treatment may also be further carried out on the sheet steel 1a following hot-dip plating treatment.\nIn this case, workability of the hot-dipped steel is further improved. Overaging treatment is carried out by holding the\nsheet steel 1a within a fixed temperature range for a fixed period of time.\n[0128]FIG. 3 shows a device used for overaging treatment, with FIG. 3 (a) showing a heating apparatus and FIG. 3\n(b) showing an insulating container 20. The heating apparatus is provided with a transport device by which the sheet\nsteel 1a is continuously transported following hot-dip plating treatment. This transport device is composed of a feeder\n16, a winder 17 and a plurality of transport rollers 21 in the same manner as the transport device in the hot-dip plating\nequipment. A heating furnace 18, such as an induction heating furnace, is provided in the transport route of the sheet\nsteel 1a transported by this transport device. There are no particular limitations on the insulating container 20 provided\nit is able to hold a coil 19 of the sheet steel 1a inside and has heat insulating properties. The insulating container 20\nmay also be a large container (insulating chamber).\n[0129]In the case of carrying out overaging treatment on the sheet steel 1a, the coil 14 of the hot-dipped sheet steel\n1a is first carried from the winder 12 of the hot-dip plating equipment with a crane or cart and then held by the feeder\n16 of the heating apparatus. In the heating apparatus, the sheet steel 1a is continuously fed by first being unwound from\nthe feeder 16. After the sheet steel 1a is heated to a temperature suitable for overaging treatment with the heating\nfurnace 18, it is wound up with the winder 17, and the coil 19 of the sheet steel 1a is held by this winder 17.\n[0130]Continuing, the coil 19 of the sheet steel 1a is carried from the winder 17 with a crane or cart and held within\nthe insulating container 20. Overaging treatment is then carried out on the sheet steel 1a by holding the coil 19 of the\nsheet steel 1a in this insulating container 20 for a fixed period of time.\n[0131]According to the present embodiment, since the plating layer formed on the surface of the sheet steel 1a\ncontains Mg and only a slight Mg-based oxide film is present on the surface of the plating layer, even if plating layers\nare superimposed in a coil of the sheet steel 1a during overaging treatment, it is difficult for seizure or deposition to\noccur between the plating layers. Consequently, even if the duration of overaging treatment when the sheet steel 1a is\nheld at a fixed temperature is long, or even if the temperature at which the sheet steel 1a is held is high, it is difficult for\nseizure to occur and adequate overaging treatment can be carried out on the sheet steel 1a. As a result, workability of\nthe hot-dipped sheet steel increases considerably and the efficiency of overaging treatment improves.\n[0132]In carrying out overaging treatment, the temperature of the sheet steel 1a after heating with the heating apparatus\nin particular is preferably within the range of 180°C to 220°C, or in other words, the sheet steel is preferably moved from\noutside the insulating container to inside the insulating container in a state in which the temperature of the sheet steel\n1a is within the above-mentioned range. A holding time y (hr) of the sheet steel 1a within the insulating container preferably\nsatisfies the following formula (1).\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n16\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n (where 150 ≤ t ≤ 250)\n[0133]In formula (1), t (°C) represents the temperature (holding temperature) of the sheet steel 1a during the holding\ntime y (hr), and when there are temperature fluctuations in the sheet steel 1a, the t (°C) is the lowest temperature among\nthose temperature fluctuations.\n[0134]Furthermore, although the hot-dip plating equipment and the heating apparatus are separate devices in the\npresent embodiment, the hot-dip plating equipment may also serve as a heating apparatus by providing the hot-dip\nplating equipment with the heating furnace 18. The designs of these devices may be suitably modified by adding, omitting\nor substituting various elements as necessary. Although the hot-dip plating equipment and heating apparatus according\nto the present embodiment are suitable for the case in which the steel substrate 1 is the sheet steel 1a, the configurations\nof the hot-dip plating equipment, heating apparatus and the like can be suitably modified in design in various ways\ncorresponding to the form and the like of the steel substrate 1. In the case plating pre-treatment is carried out on the\nsteel substrate 1, this plating pre-treatment can also be modified in various ways corresponding to the type, form and\nthe like of the steel substrate 1.\n[0135]A chemical conversion treatment layer may also be formed by superimposing on the plating layer on the steel\nsubstrate 1 that has undergone hot-dip plating treatment or overaging treatment in this manner. A coating layer consisting\nof a coating material or film or the like may be formed on the plating layer either on a chemical conversion treatment\nlayer or without having a chemical conversion treatment layer interposed there between.\n[0136]The chemical conversion treatment layer is a layer formed by a known chemical conversion treatment. Examples\nof treatment agents for forming the chemical conversion treatment layer (chemical conversion treatment agents) include\ntreatment agents containing chromium such as chromate treatment agents, trivalent chromate treatment agents, chro-\nmate treatment agents containing resin and trivalent chromate treatment agents, phosphoric acid-based treatment agents\nsuch as zinc phosphate treatment agents or iron phosphate treatment agents, oxide treatment agents containing metal\noxides such as those of cobalt, nickel, tungsten or zirconium either alone or as a complex, treatment agents containing\nan inhibitor component that prevents corrosion, treatment agents combining a binder component (such as an organic\nbinder, inorganic binder or organic-inorganic composite binder) and an inhibitor component, treatment agents combining\nan inhibitor component and a metal oxide, treatment agents combining a binder component and a sol such as that of\nsilica, titania or zirconia, and treatment agents further combining components of the previously listed treatment agents.\n[0137]Examples of treatment agents containing chromium include treatment agents prepared by blending aqueous\nand water-dispersible acrylic resins, silane coupling agents having an amino group, and chromium ion sources such as\nammonium chromate or ammonium dichromate. Water-dispersible acrylic resins can be obtained by copolymerizing\ncarboxyl group-containing monomers such as acrylic acid with glycidyl group-containing monomers such as glycidyl\nacrylate. Chemical conversion treatment layers formed from these chemical conversion treatment agents have high\nlevels of water resistance, corrosion resistance and alkaline resistance, and the formation of white rust and black rust\non hot-dipped steels is inhibited by these chemical conversion treatment layers, resulting in improved corrosion resist-\nance. In order to improve corrosion resistance and prevent coloring of the chemical conversion treatment layer, the\ncontent of chromium in the chemical conversion treatment layer is preferably within the range of 5 mg/m\n2\n to 50 mg/m\n2\n.\n[0138]Examples of oxide treatment agents containing oxides of zirconium include treatment agents prepared by\nblending aqueous and water-dispersible polyester-based urethane resins, water-dispersible acrylic resins, zirconium\ncompounds such as sodium zirconium carbonate and hindered amines. Water-dispersible polyester-based urethane\nresins are synthesized by, for example, reacting a polyester polyol with a hydrogenated isocyanate and copolymerizing\na dimethylol alkyl acid to carry out self-emulsification. This type of water-dispersible polyester-based urethane resin\nimparts a high level of water resistance to chemical conversion treatment layers without using an emulsifier, and leads\nto improvement of corrosion resistance and alkaline resistance of hot-dipped steel.\n[0139]Nickel plating treatment or cobalt plating treatment or the like may also be carried out beneath the chemical\nconversion treatment layer or in place of chemical conversion treatment.\n[0140]Surface preparation, such as cleaning with pure water or various types of organic solvents, or cleaning with an\naqueous solution or various types of organic solvents arbitrarily containing acids, alkalis and various types of etching\nagents, may be carried out on the surface of the plating layer prior to forming a chemical conversion treatment layer or\ncoating layer. If the surface of the plating layer is cleaned in this manner, even if a small amount of a Mg-based oxide\nfilm is present on the surface layer of the plating layer or inorganic or organic debris is adhered to the surface of the\nplating layer, the Mg-based oxide film or debris is removed from the plating layer, thereby making it possible to improve\nadhesion between the plating layer and the chemical conversion treatment layer or coating layer.\n[0141]The following provides an explanation of the usefulness of surface preparation in actively removing an Mg-\nbased oxide film from the plating layer. Mg-based oxide films have the common property of easily dissolving when\ncontacted with acidic aqueous solutions. For example, when the surface of the hot-dipped steel is exposed to an acidic\nwet state in a corrosive environment, the Mg-based oxide film dissolves and separates from the surface. As a result,\nwhen a chemical conversion treatment layer or coating layer is adhered to an Mg-based oxide film on the surface layer\nof the plating layer, there is the possibility of adhesion between the plating layer and the chemical conversion treatment\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n17\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nlayer or coating layer decreasing greatly. Thus, actively removing the Mg-based oxide layer by surface preparation is\npreferably carried out as necessary.\n[0142]The chemical conversion treatment layer can be formed by a known method such as roll coating, spraying,\ndipping, electrolysis or air knife coating using a chemical conversion treatment agent. After applying the chemical con-\nversion treatment agent, steps such as drying and baking may be further added as necessary by leaving at normal\ntemperatures or using a heating apparatus such as a hot air oven, electric furnace or induction heating furnace. A curing\nmethod may also be applied using an energy beam such as infrared rays, ultraviolet rays or electron beam. The tem-\nperature during drying, drying time and the like are suitably determined corresponding to the type of chemical conversion\ntreatment agent used, the required level of productivity and the like. A chemical conversion treatment layer formed in\nthis manner becomes a continuous or non-continuous film on the plating layer. The thickness of the chemical conversion\ntreatment layer is suitably determined corresponding to the type of treatment, required level of performance and the like.\n[0143]A coating layer formed from a coating material or film or the like can also be formed using a known method. In\nthe case of forming the coating layer from a coating material, examples of coating materials used include polyester resin-\nbased coating materials, epoxy resin-based coating materials, acrylic resin-based coating materials, fluorine resin-based\ncoating materials, silicon resin-based coating materials, amino resin-based coating materials, urethane resin-based\ncoating materials, vinyl chloride resin-based coating materials and composite coating materials obtained by combining\nthese coating materials. A known method can be employed to coat with the coating material, examples of which include\nroll coating, curtain coating, spraying, dipping, electrolysis and air knife coating. The coating material is applied onto the\nplating layer or onto a chemical conversion treatment layer in the case of forming a chemical conversion treatment layer\nor the like. After applying the coating material, the coating layer is formed by drying and baking the coating material as\nnecessary by air drying or by using a heating apparatus such as a hot air oven, electric furnace or induction heating\nfurnace. In the case of using an energy beam-curable coating material, the curing layer may be formed by curing the\ncoating material with an energy beam such as infrared rays, ultraviolet rays or electron beam after coating. The temper-\nature when drying the coating material and the drying time are suitably determined corresponding to the type of coating\nmaterial used, required level of productivity and the like. The coating layer may be a continuous or non-continuous film.\n[0144]The thickness of the coating layer formed from a coating material is suitably determined corresponding to the\ntype of coating material, required level of performance and the like. For example, in the case of using the hot-dipped\nsteel as a sheet metal product (product subjected to mechanical processing after coating), an undercoating layer having\na thickness of about 2 mm to 15 mm and an overcoating layer having a thickness of about 5 mm to 200 mm are preferably\nformed as coating layers, through the chemical conversion treatment layer. In the case of carrying out coating after\nmechanical processing has been carried out on the hot-dipped steel, or after further implementing the processed hot-\ndipped steel by using as a building material, the thickness of the coating layer is preferably thicker, such as having a\nthickness of several millimeters.\n[0145]In the case of forming the coating layer from a film, examples of the film include vinyl chloride-based films,\npolyester resin-based films, acrylic resin-based films, fluorine-resin based films, composite films obtained by combining\nthese resins, and laminated films obtained by laminating these films. Such a film is heat-sealed onto or adhered with an\nadhesive onto the plating layer or onto a chemical conversion treatment layer or the like (in the case such a chemical\nconversion treatment layer or the like is formed), thereby forming the coating layer.\n[0146]Although the thickness of the coating layer formed from a film is suitably determined corresponding to the type\nof film, required level of performance, cost and the like, the thickness is, for example, within the range of 5 mm to 500\nmm. The coating layer may have a thickness on the millimeter order corresponding to the application of the hot-dipped\nsteel.\n[0147]A coating layer formed from a coating material or film may be formed directly on the plating layer or may be\nformed by having another layer, such as a chemical conversion treatment layer, interposed there between. The coating\nlayer may be formed from only a coating material or from only a film, or may be formed by combining and laminating a\nlayer formed from a coating material and a layer formed from a film.\n[0148]Moreover, a clear coating material may be coated and deposited while superimposing the coating layer to form\na clear layer on the coating layer.\n[0149]Since the hot-dipped steel produced according to the present embodiment inhibits the formation of an Mg-\nbased oxide film on the surface layer of the plating layer and inhibits the formation of surface irregularities in the plating\nsurface accompanying wrinkling and running, in comparison with conventional Mg-containing plated steel materials, the\nhot-dipped steel according to the present embodiment is able to demonstrate favorable chemical conversion treatment\nproperties, favorable adhesion of a coating layer, and a favorable appearance of the surface following formation of the\ncoating layer. Moreover, this hot-dipped steel demonstrates favorable corrosion resistance.\n[0150]This hot-dipped steel can be employed in materials for automobiles, materials for home appliances and various\ntypes of other applications, and can be preferably employed in applications requiring corrosion resistance in particular.\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n18\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nEXAMPLES\n[0151]The following provides an explanation of examples of the present invention.\n[Examples and Comparative Examples]\n[0152]A long piece of sheet steel 1a (made of low-carbon aluminum-killed steel) having a thickness of 0.80 mm and\nwidth of 1000 mm was used for the steel substrate 1. Furthermore, Ni-plating was carried out prior to carrying out hot-\ndip plating treatment on the sheet steel 1a in Examples 62 and 63, and a pre-plating layer was formed at an adhered\namount (one side) of 0.5 g/m\n2\n in Example 62 and at an adhered amount (one side) of 2.0 gm\n2\n in Example 63. In Example\n64, pre-plating treatment with Zn and 10% Cr was carried out, and a pre-plating layer was formed at an adhered amount\n(one side) of 1.0 g/m\n2\n. Pre-plating treatment was not carried out in the other examples and comparative examples.\n[0153]Hot-dip plating treatment was carried out on the sheet steel 1a using the hot-dip plating equipment shown in\nFIG. 1. Treatment conditions were as shown in Tables 1 to 4. The solidification starting temperatures shown in Tables\n1 to 3 were derived from liquidus curves of a phase diagram of a Zn-Al two-component bath, and correspond to the\ncontents of Al in each of the hot-dip plating bath compositions shown in Tables 1 to 3.\n[0154]The temperature of the sheet steel 1a was 580°C when the sheet steel 1a was immersed into the hot-dip plating\nbath 2.\n[0155]When the sheet steel 1a was pulled out from the hot-dip plating bath 2, the sheet steel 1a was pulled out into\nan air atmosphere, after which gas wiping was also carried out in an air atmosphere. In Example 65, however, in addition\nto surrounding the transport route of the sheet steel 1a on the upstream side from the hot-dip plating bath 2 with a sealing\nbox (the hollow member 22), spray nozzles 9 were arranged within this sealing box, and together with using a nitrogen\natmosphere for the inside of this sealing box, gas wiping was carried out with nitrogen gas inside the hollow member 22.\n[0156]In the heating apparatus 10, the sheet steel 1a was cooled until the surface temperature of the hot-dip plating\nmetal (plating layer) reached 300°C. The cooling rate during cooling was 45°C/sec. In Examples 70 and 71, however,\nthe cooling rate was changed in a temperature range in which the surface temperature of the hot-dip plating metal was\n500°C or higher, and the cooling rate during that time was 38°C/sec in Example 70 and 28°C/sec in Example 71.\n[0157]The rolling reduction rate of temper rolling was 1%, and the elongation rate of the sheet steel 1a during shape\ncorrection was also 1%.\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n19\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[Table 1]\nHot-Dip Plating Bath Composition (wt%)\nSolidification \nstarting time\nBath \ntemp.\nAdhered amt. \n(both

(hot-dipped sheet steel) obtained in\neach of the examples and comparative examples.\n(Evaluation of Volume Percentage of Si-Mg Phase)\n[0161]A sample was obtained by cutting the hot-dipped sheet steel. After embedding the sample in resin so as to\nexpose the cut surface, the cut surface was polished to a mirrored finish. When the cut surface was observed with an\nelectron microscope, the Si-Mg phase was clearly observed to be distributed in the plating layer.\n[0162]An image obtained by photographing a cut surface of the hot-dipped sheet steel obtained in Example 5 with\nan electron microscope is shown in FIG. 4(a). Moreover, elemental analysis was carried out on a portion in which\nprecipitation of the Si-Mg phase was observed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The result is\nshown in FIG. 4(b). According to this result, only the two elements of Mg and Si can be seen to be strongly detected.\nAlthough oxygen (O) was also detected, this is the result of having detected oxygen that adsorbed to the sample during\nsample preparation.\n[0163]Percent area (%) of the Si-Mg phase in the cut surface was measured by carrying out image analysis based\non the photographed image over a range of a length of 20 mm in a direction perpendicular to the direction of thickness\non the cut surface of the plating layer. The Si-Mg phase was colored dark gray, and was able to be easily identified by\nimage analysis since it was clearly distinguished from other phases.\n[0164]The volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase was evaluated by considering the percent area (%) obtained in\nthis manner to coincide with the volume percentage of the Si-Mg phase. The results are shown in Tables 5 to 8.\n(Evaluation of Weight Ratio of Amount of Mg in Si-Mg Phase to Total Mg Weight)\n[0165]The weight ratio of the amount of Mg in the Si-Mg phase to the total weight of Mg in the plating layer was\ncalculated according to the previously described formulas (1) to (3). The results are shown in Tables 4 to 6.\n(Evaluation of Amount of Mg in Surface Layer)\n[0166]Elemental analysis in the direction of depth (direction of thickness of plating layer) was carried out on components\ncontained in the plating layer of the hot-dipped sheet steel by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES).\nIn carrying out measurement, emission intensity of elements contained in the plating layer were measured under con-\nditions consisting of a diameter of the measured area of 4 mm, output of 35 W, use of Ar gas for the measurement\natmosphere, measurement pressure of 600 Pa, use of normal sputtering for the discharge mode, duty cycle of 0.1,\nanalysis time of 80 seconds and sampling time of 0.02 sec/point. In order to convert the resulting emission intensity\nvalues to quantitative concentration values (concentration as wt%), elemental analyses were also separately carried out\non reference samples such as 7000 series Al alloy or steel materials having known component concentrations. Further-\nmore, since GD-OES data is in the form of changes in emission intensity versus sputtering time, sputter depth was\nmeasured by observing cross-sections of the samples following completion of measurement, sputtering speed was\ncalculated by dividing the resulting sputter depth by total sputtering time, and the depth location of the plating layer was\nspecified in a GD-OES depth direction profile.\n[0167]Analysis results for Example 5 and Example 44 are shown in FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. According to\nthe results, the concentration of Mg in the surface layer of the plating layer was able to be confirmed to increase rapidly\nin Example 44.\n[0168]On the basis of this result, the content of Mg was derived in an area having a size of 4 mm in diameter and a\ndepth of 50 nm in the outermost layer of the plating layer having a depth of 50 nm. The results are shown in Tables 5 to 8.\n(Evaluation of Amount of Cr in Surface Layer)\n[0169]Integrated values of Cr emission intensity were measured in an area having a size of 4 mm in diameter and a\ndepth of 50 nm from the outermost surface of the plating layer by GD-OES in the same manner as in the case of\n\"Evaluation of Amount of Mg in Surface Layer\". Integrated values of Cr emission intensity were similarly measured for\nthe entire plating layer, and the ratios of the integrated values of Cr emission intensity in the above-mentioned area to\nthe values for the entire plating layer were determined. Cr content was then calculated in an area having a size of 4 mm\nin diameter and a depth of 50 nm from the outermost surface of the plating layer based on the ratio of the integrated\nvalues of Cr emission intensity and chemical analysis values of the amount of Cr in the entire plating layer as determined\nby ICP. The results are shown in Tables 5 to 8.\n\nEP 2 537 954 B1\n26\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n(Evaluation of Area Ratio of Si-Mg Phase on Surface of Plating Layer)\n[0170]The surface of the plating layer was observed with an electron microscope. A photograph of the surface of the\nplating layer of Example 5 as captured with an electron microscope is shown in FIG. 6. According to this observation\nresult, the Si-Mg phase was clearly observed to be distributed on the surface of the plating layer. On the basis of this\nresult, the area of the Si-Mg phase on the surface of the plating layer was measured, and the area ratio of the Si-Mg\nphase on the surface of the plating layer was calculated on the basis thereof. The results are shown in Tables 5 to 8.\n(Evaluation of Alloy Layer)\n[0171]A sample was obtained by cutting the hot-dipped sheet steel. After embedding this sample in resin so as to\nexpose the cut surface, the cut surface was polished to a mirrored finish. An alloy layer was present in this cut surface\nthat was interposed at the interface between the plating layer and the sheet steel 1a. The thickness of this alloy layer\nwas measured. Moreover, a portion of the polished surface measuring 10 mm 3 20 mm was sampled from the polished\nsurface with a focused ion beam device, and a microsample was prepared that was processed to a thickness of 50 nm\nor less. The Cr concentration in the alloy layer of this microsample was then analyzed using an energy-dispersive X-ray\nspectrometer (EDS) under conditions of an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and probe diameter of 1 nm.\n[0172]The ratio of the weight ratio of Cr in the alloy layer to the weight ratio of Cr in the plating layer was then calculated\nbased on this result. The results are shown in Tables 5 to 8.\n[Table 5]\nSi-Mg phase \nvolume \npercentage\nMg \nweight \nratio\nSurface \nlayer Mg \ncontent\nSurface \nlayer Cr \ncontent\nSi-Mg phase \narea ratio on \nplating layer \nsurface\nAlloy layer\nThicknessCr \ncontent \nratio\nvol%%wt%ppm by \nweight\narea%mm--\nExamples    14.5442.933.23087.00.030.5\n23.6542.332.91396.10.062.1\n33.2139.329.83304.20.507.5\n43.0938.929.53333.41.0014.6\n52.9938.529.13123.21.5022.9\n62.6033.729.03213.32.0029.4\n72.2033.328.02982.92.5038.8\n81.3520.629.12664.02.9049.2\nComp.

An epoxy-\nbased undercoating material (Product No. P-152S, Nippon Paint Co., Ltd.) was coated to a thickness of 5 mm on the\nchemical conversion treatment layer followed by heating and baking to form an undercoating layer.

Under such a social environment, an\nimprovement in performance of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is of course a pressing issue.\n[0003]Further, according to the usage, favorable magnetic properties in a rolling direction are sometimes required for\na non-oriented electrical steel sheet. For example, a non-oriented electrical steel sheet used for a divided iron core\namong iron cores of rotary machines, and a non-oriented electrical steel sheet used for iron cores of medium or small\nsized transformers, are sometimes required to improve magnetic properties in a rolling direction. In these iron cores,\nmagnetic fluxes mainly flow in orthogonal two directions. Further, it is often the case that the rolling direction of the non-\noriented electrical steel sheet is set to one direction, out of these two directions, in which an influence of the flow of the\nmagnetic flux is particularly large.\n[0004]Accordingly, various techniques have been conventionally proposed for the purpose of improving the magnetic\nproperties of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0005]For example, a technique of increasing contents of Si and Al for the purpose of reducing an iron loss has been\nproposed. For instance, Patent Literature 1 describes a non-oriented electrical steel sheet in which an Al content is\nincreased while keeping a relatively low Si content for the purpose of improving workability during performing cold-rolling.\nA technique in which not only the increase in contents of Si and/or Al and the like but also the reduction in contents of\nC, S, N and the like is realized, has also been proposed. Techniques of reducing an iron loss by making impurities\nharmless through chemical treatment such as an addition of Ca (Patent Literature 2), and an addition of REM (Patent\nLiterature 3), have also been proposed. Further, Patent Literature 4 describes a technique regarding a condition of finish\nannealing.\n[0006]For example, a technique regarding an improvement in magnetic flux density has also been proposed. For\ninstance, Patent Literature 5 describes a technique regarding a condition of hot-rolled sheet annealing and a condition\nof cold-rolling. Further, Patent Literature 6 describes a technique regarding an addition of alloying elements of Sn, Cu\nand the like.\n[0007]However, with the conventional techniques, it is difficult to sufficiently improve the magnetic properties in the\nrolling direction of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. Further, with the technique in which the contents of Si and Al\nare increased for the purpose of reducing the iron loss, a saturation magnetic flux density becomes low. In particular,\nAl easily reduces the saturation magnetic flux density, when compared to Si, so that with the technique described in\nPatent Literature 1, the saturation magnetic flux density becomes extremely low. Such a technique in which the saturation\nmagnetic flux density becomes low, is absolutely inappropriate for the miniaturization of electric equipments.\nCITATION LIST\nPATENT LITERATURE\n[0008]Patent Literature 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 07-228953\nPatent Literature 2: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 03-126845\nPatent Literature 3: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2006-124809\nPatent Literature 4: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 61-231120\nPatent Literature 5: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2004-197217\nPatent Literature 6: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 05-140648\nPatent Literature 7: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 52-129612\nPatent Literature 8: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 53-66816\nPatent Literature 9: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2001-172718\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\nTECHNICAL PROBLEM\n[0009]The present invention has an object to provide a manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet\ncapable of improving magnetic properties in a rolling direction.\nSOLUTION TO PROBLEM\n[0010]The present inventors repeatedly conducted earnest studies from a point of view in which magnetic properties\nin a rolling direction in a non-oriented electrical steel sheet are improved by changing conditions of contents of respective\ncomponents, treatment before cold-rolling, the number of times of the cold-rolling, a rolling reduction in the cold-rolling\nand the like.\n[0011]As a result, although details will be described later, the present inventors found out that it is possible to obtain\nan effect of significantly improving the magnetic properties in the rolling direction, by providing appropriate contents of\nSi, Al, Mn and the like, an appropriate finish temperature in hot-rolling, an appropriate number of times of cold-rolling,\nand an appropriate rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling. Further, the present inventors came to the following\nmanufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0012](1) A manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet, including:\nperforming hot-rolling of a steel material so as to form a steel strip, the steel material containing, in mass%:\nSi: not less than 0.1% nor more than 4.0%;\nAl: not less than 0.1% nor more than 3.0%; and\nMn: not less than 0.1% nor more than 2.0%;\na C content being 0.003% or less, and\na balance being composed of Fe and inevitable impurity elements;\nnext, performing first cold-rolling of the steel strip;\nnext, performing intermediate annealing of the steel strip;\nnext, performing second cold-rolling of the steel strip; and\nnext, performing finish annealing of the steel strip, wherein\na finish temperature in the hot-rolling is 900°C or less,\nthe first cold-rolling is started without performing annealing after the hot-rolling; and\na rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling is not less than 40% nor more than 85%.\n[0013](2) The manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (1), wherein the steel material\ncontains, in mass%, one or two selected from a group consisting of Sn: not less than 0.02% nor more than 0.40% and\nCu: not less than 0.1% nor more than 1.0%.\n[0014](3) The manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (1) or (2), wherein the steel\nmaterial contains, in mass%, P: 0.15% or less.\n[0015](4) The manufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to any one of (1) to (3), wherein\nthe steel material contains, in mass%, Cr: not less than 0.2% nor more than 10.0%.\nADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION\n[0016]According to the present invention, conditions in a process particularly from hot-rolling to cold-rolling are ap-\npropriately specified, so that it is possible to improve magnetic properties in a rolling direction.\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0017]Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. In the present embodiment, a\nsteel material (slab) having a predetermined composition is hot-rolled so as to form a steel strip, and cold-rolling of the\nsteel strip is then performed twice with intermediate annealing therebetween. Thereafter, the steel strip is subjected to\nfinish annealing. Moreover, a finish temperature in the hot-rolling, namely, a temperature in the finish rolling is 900°C or\nless, and the first cold-rolling is started without performing annealing after the hot-rolling. In other words, the first cold-\nrolling is started while maintaining a metallic structure of the steel strip at the end of the hot-rolling. Further, a rolling\nreduction in the second cold-rolling is not less than 40% nor more than 85%.\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0018]Next, a composition of a steel material used in the present embodiment will be described. Hereinafter, \"%\"\nbeing a unit of content means \"mass%\". The present embodiment uses, for example, a steel containing Si: not less than\n0.1% nor more than 4.0%, Al: not less than 0.1% nor more than 3.0%, and Mn: not less than 0.1% nor more than 2.0%,\na C content of the steel being 0.003% or less, and a balance of the steel being composed of Fe and inevitable impurity\nelements. The steel may also contain one or two of Sn: not less than 0.02% nor more than 0.40% and Cu: not less than\n0.1% nor more than 1.0%, the steel may also contain P: 0.15% or less, and the steel may also contain Cr: not less than\n0.2% nor more than 10.0%. The steel material may be produced by making a steel melted in a converter, an electric\nfurnace or the like to be subjected to continuous casting, or by making an ingot using the steel and making the ingot to\nbe subjected to blooming.\n[0019]Si has an effect of reducing an iron loss by increasing an electrical resistance of a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet to reduce an eddy current loss. Further, Si also has an effect of improving punchability when the steel sheet is\nprocessed into a shape of iron core or the like by increasing a yield ratio. When a Si content is less than 0.1%, these\neffects are insufficient. On the other hand, when the Si content exceeds 4.0%, a magnetic flux density of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet is lowered. Besides, a hardness is excessively high, so that the punchability is lowered and the\nworkability during the cold-rolling and the like is lowered. Further, this also leads to an increase in cost. Therefore, the\nSi content is not less than 0.1% nor more than 4.0%. Moreover, in order to obtain better magnetic properties, the Si\ncontent is preferably 2.0% or more.\n[0020]Al, similar to Si, has an effect of reducing the iron loss by increasing the electrical resistance of the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet to reduce the eddy current loss. Moreover, Al also has an effect of increasing a ratio of a magnetic\nflux density B50 to a saturation magnetic flux density Bs (B50/Bs) to improve a magnetic flux density. When an Al content\nis less than 0.1%, these effects are insufficient. On the other hand, when the Al content exceeds 3.0%, the saturation\nmagnetic flux density itself is lowered, resulting in that the magnetic flux density is lowered. Further, when compared to\nSi, Al is difficult to cause an increase in hardness, but, when the Al content exceeds 3.0%, the yield ratio is decreased\nto lower the punchability. Therefore, the Al content is not less than 0.1% nor more than 3.0%. Further, in order to secure\na high saturation magnetic flux density and the like, the Al content is preferably 2.5% or less. Here, the magnetic flux\ndensity B50 is a magnetic flux density under a condition where a frequency is 50 Hz, and the maximum magnetizing\nforce is 5000 A/m.\n[0021]Mn has an effect of reducing the iron loss by increasing the electrical resistance of the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet to reduce the eddy current loss. Moreover, Mn also has an effect of developing {110}<001> orientation, which\nis desirable for the improvement in magnetic properties in the rolling direction, by improving a primary recrystallization\nstructure. Furthermore, Mn suppresses a precipitation of fine sulfide (MnS or the like, for example), which inhibits the\ngrowth of crystal grains. When a Mn content is less than 0.1%, these effects are insufficient. On the other hand, when\nthe Mn content exceeds 2.0%, it is difficult for crystal grains to grow during the intermediate annealing, resulting in that\nthe iron loss is increased. Therefore, the Mn content is not less than 0.1% nor more than 2.0%. Further, in order to\nfurther reduce the iron loss, the Mn content is preferably less than 1.0%.\n[0022]C has an effect of increasing the iron loss, and it may be also a cause of magnetic aging. Further, when C is\ncontained in a steel strip during cold-rolling at room temperature, the development of the {110}<001> orientation, which\nis desirable for the improvement in the magnetic properties in the rolling direction, is sometimes suppressed. These\nphenomena are significant when a C content exceeds 0.003%. Therefore, the C content is 0.003% or less.\n[0023]Sn has an effect of developing the {110}<001> orientation, which is desirable for the improvement in the magnetic\nproperties in the rolling direction, by improving the primary recrystallization structure, and it also has an effect of controlling\na {111}<112> orientation and the like, which are undesirable for the improvement in the magnetic properties. Moreover,\nSn has an effect of suppressing oxidation and nitriding on a surface of the steel strip during the intermediate annealing,\nand it also has an effect of adjusting growth of crystal grains. When a Sn content is less than 0.02%, these effects are\ninsufficient. On the other hand, when the Sn content exceeds 0.40%, these effects saturate and, on the contrary, the\ngrowth of crystal grains during the intermediate annealing is sometimes suppressed. Therefore, the Sn content is pref-\nerably not less than 0.02% nor more than 0.40%.\n[0024]Cu, similar to Sn, has an effect of developing the {110}<001> orientation, which is desirable for the improvement\nin the magnetic properties in the rolling direction, by improving the primary recrystallization structure. When a Cu content\nis less than 0.1%, this effect is insufficient. On the other hand, when the Cu content exceeds 1.0%, a hot embrittlement\nis caused, resulting in that the workability in the hot-rolling is lowered. Therefore, the Cu content is preferably not less\nthan 0.1% nor more than 1.0%.\n[0025]P has an effect of increasing the yield ratio to improve the punchability. However, when a P content exceeds\n0.15%, the hardness is increased too much, and the embrittlement is caused. As a result, the workability in the manu-\nfacturing process of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is lowered, and the workability in a customer, namely, in a\nuser of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is lowered. Therefore, the P content is preferably 0.15% or less.\n[0026]Cr has an effect of reducing the iron loss such as a high-frequency iron loss by increasing the electrical resistance\nof the non-oriented electrical steel sheet to reduce the eddy current loss. The reduction in the high-frequency iron loss\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nis suitable for enabling high-speed rotation of a rotary machine. By enabling the high-speed rotation of the rotary machine,\nit is possible to deal with the demand for the realization of miniaturization and high-efficiency of the rotary machine.\nMoreover, Cr also has an effect of suppressing a stress sensitivity. By suppressing the stress sensitivity, a variation in\nproperties caused by a stress during processing such as punching, and a variation in properties caused by a stress\nvariation during the high-speed rotation are reduced. When a Cr content is less than 0.2%, these effects are insufficient.\nOn the other hand, when the Cr content exceeds 10.0%, the magnetic flux density is lowered and the cost is increased.\nTherefore, the Cr content is preferably not less than 0.2% nor more than 10.0%.\n[0027]The components of the steel except the above-described components may be Fe and inevitable impurities, for\nexample. Incidentally, when the Si content (%), the Al content (%) and the Mn content (%) are represented by [Si], [Al]\nand [Mn], respectively, a value obtained through an expression \"[Si]+[Al]  +[Mn]   /2\" is preferably 4.5% or less. This is for\nsecuring the workability in the processing of cold-rolling and the like.\n[0028]Next, explanation will be made on experiments by which it is concluded that conditions for the hot-rolling, the\ncold-   rolling and the like are defined as described above.\n[0029]The present inventors first produced steel slabs each containing components presented in Table 1 and a\nbalance composed of Fe and inevitable impurities. Then, hot-rolling of each steel slab was conducted so as to produce\na steel strip (hot-rolled sheet), and cold-rolling was performed twice. At this time, the first cold-rolling was started without\nperforming hot-rolled sheet annealing after the hot-rolling, and intermediate annealing was conducted at 1000°C for 1\nminute between the two times of cold-rolling. A thickness of each steel strip after the cold-rolling (cold-rolled sheet) was\nset to 0.35 mm. Finish temperatures in the hot-rolling, thicknesses of the hot-rolled sheets, thicknesses of the steel strips\nafter the first cold-rolling, and rolling reductions in the second cold-rolling are presented in Table 2. After performing the\nsecond cold-rolling, finish annealing was performed at 950°C for 30 seconds. As is apparent from table 2, a rolling\nreduction in the first cold-rolling was set to 31.4% to 36.4%. Then, a sample was taken from each steel strip after the\nfinish annealing, and as magnetic properties thereof, a magnetic flux density B50 and an iron loss W15/50 were measured.\nHere, the iron loss W15/50 is an iron loss under a condition where a frequency is 50 Hz, and the maximum magnetic\nflux density is 1.5T. Results of these are also presented in Table 2.\n[0030][Table 1]\n[0031][Table 2]\nTABLE 1\nCOMPONENT OF STEEL SLAB (MASS%)\nCSiAlMnP\n0.0019   2.910.480.27    0.022\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTABLE 2\nCONDITION No.\nFINISH \nTEMPERATURE IN \nHOT-ROLLING (°C)\nTHICKNESS OF \nHOT-ROLLED \nSHEET (mm)\nTHICKNESS AFTER \nFIRST \nCOLD-ROLLING \n(mm)\nROLLDING \nREDUCTION IN \nSECOND \nCOLD-ROLLING (%)\nMAGNETIC FLUX \nDENSITY IN \nROLLING \nDIRECTION B50 (T)\nIRON ROSS IN \nROLLING DIRECTION \nW15/50 (W/kg)\n1\n851\n0.8\n0.55\n36.4\n1.69\n2.23\n2\n856\n1.1\n0.70\n50.0\n1.74\n1.91\n3\n957\n1.5\n1.00\n65.0\n1.72\n2.14\n4\n855\n1.5\n1.00\n65.0\n1.15\n1.83\n5\n842\n4.0\n2.70\n87.0\n1.69\n2.27\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0032]It can be understood that in the condition where the hot-rolled sheet annealing is not performed, the magnetic\nproperties in the rolling direction of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet can be significantly improved by appropriately\ncombining the finish temperature in the hot-rolling and the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling, as seen from Table\n2. In other words, it can be said that when the finish temperature in the hot-rolling is 900°C or less, and the rolling\nreduction in the second cold-rolling is not less than 40% nor more than 85%, it is possible to obtain extremely good\nmagnetic properties in the rolling direction.\n[0033]In a condition No. 1, the rolling reduction in the second cold-, in a condition No. 5, the rolling reduction in the\nsecond cold-rolling was set to 87.0%, being over 85%. For this reason, in the conditions No. 1 and No. 5, the magnetic\nproperties in the rolling direction were inferior to those in conditions No. 2 and No. 4.\n[0034]Further, in a condition No. 3, the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling was set to 65.0%, but, the finish\ntemperature in the hot-rolling was set to 957°C, being over 950°C. For this reason, the magnetic properties in the rolling\ndirection were inferior to those in the conditions No. 2 and No. 4.\n[0035]As described above, in the condition where the hot-rolled sheet annealing is not performed, by setting the finish\ntemperature in the hot-rolling to 900°C or less, and by setting the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling to not less\nthan 40% nor more than 85%, it is possible to obtain extremely good magnetic properties in the rolling direction. The\nfollowing can be considered as the reason thereof. To start the first cold-rolling with the finish temperature in the hot-\nrolling being 900°C or less and without performing the hot-rolled sheet annealing is the same as to start the first cold-\nrolling while maintaining a metallic structure of the steel strip at the end of the finish rolling. Therefore, a high proportion\nof non-recrystallized rolled texture having the {110}<001> orientation is maintained. When the intermediate annealing\nis performed under the state of maintaining the high proportion of rolled texture, and then the second cold-rolling is\nconducted at the rolling reduction of not less than 40% nor more than 85%, crystal grains in the {110}<001> orientation\ngrow during recrystallization caused by the finish annealing performed after the cold-rolling. As described above, the\ncrystal grains in the {110}<001> orientation contribute to the improvement in the magnetic properties in the rolling\ndirection. Incidentally, in order to more securely maintain high proportion of non-recrystallized rolled texture, it is preferable\nto set the finish temperature to 860°C or less.\n[0036]Further, the effect obtained by setting the finish temperature in the hot-rolling to 900°C or less, starting the first\ncold-rolling without performing the hot-rolled sheet annealing, and setting the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling\nto not less than 40% nor more than 85% is significant when the Si content is 2.0% or more, which is a favorable content.\nThis is because, when the Si content is 2.0% or more, a proportion of non-recrystallized rolled texture is increased, and\nwhen the recrystallization is once started, an activation energy of the growth of crystal grains is increased, resulting in\nthat the growth of crystal grains in the {110}<001> orientation is significantly facilitated.\n[0037]Besides, regarding the Young’s modulus in each crystal orientation of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet,\nthe Young’s modulus in the {110}<001> orientation is smaller than the Young’s modulus in the crystal orientation such\nas the {111}<112> orientation, which is undesirable for the improvement in the magnetic properties. The texture of the\nnon-oriented electrical steel sheet manufactured by the present embodiment has a significantly developed {110}<001>\norientation. Therefore, the Young’s modulus of the non-oriented electrical steel sheet manufactured by the present\nembodiment is relatively low. When the Young’s modulus is low, even if a compressive strain is applied in a shrink fitting\nor the like when producing an iron core from the non-oriented electrical steel sheet, a compressive stress generated\ndue to the compressive strain is low. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, it is also possible to reduce the\ndeterioration of magnetic properties due to the compressive stress. In other words, according to the present embodiment,\nit is also possible to achieve an effect such that, in addition to the realization of the improvement in the magnetic properties\nin the rolling direction, the reduction in the deterioration of magnetic properties when the compressive strain is applied\nis also realized by lowering the Young’s modulus.\n[0038]Incidentally, when the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling is less than 40%, a proportion of random\norientations increases. Further, when the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling exceeds 85%, a proportion of not\nthe {110}<001> orientation but the {111}<112> orientation increases. For this reason, in these cases, the magnetic\nproperties in the rolling direction do not improve sufficiently.\n[0039]Further, the non-oriented electrical steel sheet manufactured through the method as above is a suitable one\nas a material of iron cores of various electric equipments. In particular, the non-oriented electrical steel sheet is a desirable\none as a material of a divided iron core among iron cores of rotary machines, and further, it is a desirable one also as\na material of iron cores of middle and small sized transformers. For this reason, it is possible to realize the high-efficiency\nand the miniaturization in the fields of rotary machines, medium and small sized transformers, electrical components\nand the like which use the non-oriented electrical steel sheets as materials of their iron cores.\nEXAMPLE\n[0040]Next, experiments conducted by the present inventors will be described. Conditions and so on in these exper-\niments are examples employed to verify practicality and effects of the present invention, and the present invention is\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nnot limited to these examples.\n(Example 1)\n[0041]First, steel slabs each containing components presented in Table 3 and a balance composed of Fe and inevitable\nimpurities were produced. Then, hot-rolling of each steel slab was conducted to produce a steel strip (hot-rolled sheet),\nand cold-rolling was performed twice. At this time, the first cold-rolling was started without performing hot-rolled sheet\nannealing after the hot-rolling, and intermediate annealing was conducted at 950°C for 2 minutes between the two times\nof the cold-rolling. A thickness of each steel strip after the cold-rolling was set to 0.35 mm. Finish temperatures in the\nhot-   rolling, thicknesses of the hot-rolled sheets, thicknesses of the steel strips after performing the first cold-rolling, and\nrolling reductions in the second cold-rolling are presented in Table 4. After performing the second cold-rolling, finish\nannealing was performed at 970°C for 40 seconds. As is apparent from table 4, a rolling reduction in the first cold-rolling\nwas set to approximately 40%. Further, a sample was taken from each steel strip after the finish annealing, and as\nmagnetic properties thereof, a magnetic flux density B50 and an iron loss W10/400 were measured. The iron loss\nW10/400 is an iron loss under a condition where a frequency is 400 Hz, and the maximum magnetic flux density is 1.0T.\nResults of these are also presented in Table 4.\n[0042][Table 3]\n[0043][Table 4]\nTABEL 3\nCONDITION No.\nCOMPONENT OF STEEL SLAB (MASS%)\nCSiAlMnSnCu\n110.0022  2.691.010.23--\n120.0020  2.651.050.210.07-\n130.0021  2.710.980.250.08-\n140.0021  2.670.970.23-0.34\n150.0023  2.681.040.260.07-\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTABLE 4\nCONDITION \nNo.\nFINISH \nTEMPERATURE \nIN HOT-ROLLING \n(°C)\nTHICKNESS OF \nHOT-ROLLED \nSHEET (mm)\nTHICKNESS \nAFTER FIRST \nCOLD-ROLLING \n(mm)\nROLLDING \nREDUCTION IN \nSECOND \nCOLD-ROLLING \n(%)\nMAGNETIC \nFLUX DENSITY \nIN ROLLING \nDIRECTION B50 \n(T)\nIRON ROSS IN \nROLLING \nDIRECTION \nW10/400 (W/kg)\nREMARKS\n11\n846\n1.8\n1.1\n68.2\n1.76\n13.5\nEXAMPLE\n12\n841\n0.9\n0.5\n30.0\n1.69\n15.6\nCOMPARATIVE \nEXAMPLE\n13\n839\n1.8\n1.1\n68.2\n1.77\n13.1\nEXAMPLE\n14\n844\n1.8\n1.1\n68.2\n1.77\n13.2\nEXAMPLE\n15\n851\n4.2\n2.6\n86.5\n1.70\n15.7\nCOMPARATIVE \nEXAMPLE\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n10\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0044]In a condition No. 12, the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling was set to 30.0%, being less than 40%.\nFurther, in a condition No. 15, the rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling was set to 86.5%, being over 85%. For this\nreason, in the conditions No. 12 and No. 15, the magnetic properties in the rolling direction were inferior to those in\nconditions No. 11, No. 13 and No. 14.\n[0045]Further, in the condition No. 13, in which Sn was contained, and the condition No. 14, in which Cu was contained,\nthe magnetic properties in the rolling direction were better than those in the condition No. 11, in which Sn and Cu were\nnot contained. As seen from the results, it can be understood that when Sn or Cu is contained, the magnetic properties\nin the rolling direction are further improved. Moreover, as is apparent from Table 4, it can be understood that, according\nto the examples of the present invention, it is possible to manufacture the non-oriented electrical steel sheets excellent\nin magnetic properties in the rolling direction.\n(Example 2)\n[0046]First, steel slabs each containing components presented in Table 5 and a balance composed of Fe and inevitable\nimpurities were produced. Then, hot-rolling of each steel slab was conducted to produce a steel strip (hot-rolled sheet)\nhaving a thickness of 2.3 nm, and cold-rolling was performed twice. At this time, although the first cold-rolling was started\nwithout performing hot-rolled sheet annealing after the hot-rolling in conditions No. 21, No. 23 and No. 24, the first cold-\nrolling was conducted after performing the hot-rolled sheet annealing at 950°C for 2 minutes in a condition No. 22.\nFurther, intermediate annealing was conducted at 980°C for 1 minute between the two times of cold-rolling. Finish\ntemperatures in the hot-rolling are presented in Table 6. A thickness of each steel strip after the first cold-rolling was set\nto 0.8 mm, and a rolling reduction in the second cold-rolling was set to 62.5%, to thereby set a thickness of each steel\nstrip after the second cold-rolling to 0.30 mm. After performing the second cold-rolling, finish annealing was performed\nat 950°C for 20 seconds. Further, a sample was taken from each steel strip after the finish annealing, and as magnetic\nproperties thereof, the magnetic flux density B50 and the iron loss W10/400 were measured. Results of these are\npresented in Table 6.\n[0047][Table 5]\n[0048][Table 6]\n[0049]When comparing the condition No. 21 and the condition No. 22, although they have similar compositions of\nthe non-oriented electrical steel sheets, significantly excellent magnetic properties in the rolling direction were obtained\nTABLE 5\nCONDITION No.\nCOMPONENT OF STEEL SLAB (MASS%)\nCSiAlMnCr\n210.0017  3.051.180.35-\n220.0016  3.011.200.33-\n230.0016  3.071.170.362.35\n240.0019  3.041.220.396.47\nTABEL 6\nCONDITION \nNo.\nFINISH \nTEMPERATURE \nIN HOT-ROLLING \n(°C)\nHOT-ROLLED \nSHEET \nANNEALING\nMAGNETIC \nFLUX \nDENSITY IN \nROLLING \nDIRECTION \nB50 (T)\nIRON ROSS \nIN ROLLING \nDIRECTION \nM10/400 \n(W/kg)\nREMARKS\n21836NONE1.7512.8EXAMPLE\n22839950°C32MIN.    1.7214.5\nCOMPARATIVE \nEXAMPLE\n23832NONE1.7311.4EXAMPLE\n24829NONE1.6710.6EXAMPLE\n\nEP 2 602 335 A1\n11\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nin the condition No. 21.

Moreover, as\nis apparent from Table 6, it can be understood that, according to the examples of the present invention, it is possible to\nmanufacture the non-oriented electrical steel sheets excellent in magnetic properties in the rolling direction.\n[0051]It should be noted that the above embodiments merely illustrate concrete examples of implementing the present\ninvention, and the technical scope of the present invention is not to be construed in a restrictive manner by these\nembodiments.

It was thus believed that TiN tends to provide origins of fatigue fracture and is less effective as compared to Ti carbides for inhibiting the growth of crystal grains, which is one of the goals of the present invention.",

The non-oriented electrical steel sheet\nhas a chemical composition containing, by mass%, Si: 5.0 % or less, Mn: 2.0 % or less, Al: 2.0 % or less, and P: 0.05\n% or less, in a range satisfying formula (1), and furthermore, C: 0.008 % or more and 0.040 % or less; N: 0.003 % or\nless, and Ti: 0.04 % or less, in a range satisfying formula (2), with the balance composed of Fe and incidental impurities: \n, where Ti* = Ti - 3.4[N%].\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n2\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n3\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nDescription\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n[0001]The present invention relates to a non-oriented electrical steel sheet, and in particular, to a non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet having high strength and excellent fatigue properties, and furthermore, excellent magnetic properties that is\nsuitably used for components that are subject to high stress, typically, drive motors for turbine generators, electric vehicles\nand hybrid vehicles, or rotors for high-speed rotating machinery, such as servo motors for robots, machine tools or the\nlike, and a method for manufacturing the same. Additionally, the present invention provides the above-described non-\noriented electrical steel sheet at low cost as compared to the conventional art.\nBACKGROUND ART\n[0002]As recent advances in motor drive systems have enabled frequency control of drive power sources, more and\nmore motors are offering variable-speed operation and enabling high-speed rotation at frequencies higher than the\ncommercial frequency. In such motors enabling high-speed rotation, the centrifugal force acting on a rotating body is\nproportional to the radius of rotation and increases in proportion to the square of the rotational speed. Accordingly, in\nparticular, rotor materials for middle- and large-sized high speed motors require high strength.\n[0003]In addition, in IPM (interior permanent magnet)-type DC inverter control motors, which have been increasingly\nemployed for motors in hybrid vehicles, such as drive motors or compressor motors, stress is concentrated on portions\nbetween grooves for embedding magnets in a rotor and the outer circumference of the rotor, or at narrow bridge portions\nof several millimeters width between the grooves for embedding magnets. Since motors can be reduced in size with\nincreasing rotational speed, there is a growing demand for increasing the rotational speed of motors, such as in drive\nmotors for hybrid vehicles with space and weight constraints. As such, high strength  materials are advantageously used\nas core materials for use in rotors of high speed motors.\n[0004]On the other hand, since rotating equipment such as motors or generators makes use of electromagnetic\nphenomenon, the core materials of iron cores of rotating equipment are also required to have excellent magnetic prop-\nerties. In particular, it is necessary for rotors of high speed motors to assume low iron loss at high frequency; iron loss\nat high frequency would otherwise lead to a rise in core temperature due to the eddy current induced by a high-frequency\nmagnetic flux, causing thermal demagnetization of embedded permanent magnets, reducing motor efficiency, and so\non. Therefore, there is a demand for such an electrical steel sheet as a material for rotors that possesses high strength\nand excellent magnetic properties.\n[0005]Steel-strengthening mechanisms include solid solution strengthening, precipitation strengthening, crystal grain\nrefinement, work hardening, and so on. To date, a number of high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheets have\nbeen considered and proposed to meet the needs, such as those of rotors of high speed motors.\nAs an example utilizing solid solution strengthening, for instance, JP 60-238421 A (PTL 1) proposes a method for\nincreasing the strength of steel by adding elements such as Ti, W, Mo, Mn, Ni, Co or Al to the steel for the purposes of\nprimarily increasing Si content from 3.5 % to 7.0 %, and furthermore, achieving solid solution strengthening. Moreover,\nin addition to the above-described strengthening methods, JP 62-112723 A (PTL 2) proposes a method for improving\nmagnetic properties by controlling the crystal grain size in the range of 0.01 mm to 5.0 mm through manipulation of the\nfinal annealing conditions.\n[0006]However, when these methods are applied to factory production, the factory production may be more prone to\na trouble such as sheet fracture in a rolling line after hot rolling, which would cause a reduction in yield and production\nline stop by necessity. Sheet fracture may be reduced if cold rolling is performed in warm conditions at sheet temperatures\nof hundreds of degrees centigrade, in which case, however, process control issues will be of considerable concern, such\nas adaptation of the facility to warm rolling, tighter production constraints, and so on.\n[0007]In addition, as a technique utilizing precipitation of carbonitrides, JP 06-330255 A (PTL 3) proposes a technique\nthat makes use of strengthening by precipitation and grain refining effects provided by carbonitrides in steel, the steel\ncontaining Si in the range of 2.0 % or more and less than 4.0 %, C in the range of 0.05 % or less, and one or two of Nb,\nZr, Ti and V in the range of 0.1 < (Nb + Zr) / 8(C + N) < 1.0, and 0.4 < (Ti + V) / 4(C + N) < 4.0. Similarly, JP 02-008346\nA (PTL 4) proposes a technique, in addition to the features described in PTL 3, to add Ni and Mn in a total amount of\n0.3 % or more and 10 % or less to steel for solid solution strengthening, and further add Nb, Zr, Ti and V in the same\nratios as those described in PTL 3 to the steel, thereby balancing high strength with magnetic properties.\n[0008]However, if these methods are applied to obtain high strength, problems arise that not only unavoidably cause\na deterioration of magnetic properties, but also make the resulting products susceptible to surface defects such as scabs\ncaused by precipitates, internal defects, and so on, resulting in lower product quality, and furthermore, prone to a reduction\nin yield due to removal of defects and a fracture trouble during production of steel sheets, resulting in an increased cost.\nIn addition, the technique described in PTL 4 will lead to an even greater increase in cost because it involves adding an\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nexpensive solid-solution-strengthening element, such as Ni.\n[0009]Further, as a technique utilizing work hardening, JP 2005-113185 A (PTL 5) proposes a technique for enhancing\nthe strength of steel containing Si in the range of 0.2 % to 3.5 % by allowing worked microstructures to remain in the\nsteel material. Specifically, PTL 5 discloses means that does not perform heat treatment after cold rolling, or, if it does,\nretains the steel material at 750 °C for 30 seconds at most, preferably at 700 °C or lower, more preferably at 650 °C or\nlower, 600 °C or lower, 550 °C or lower, and 500 °C or lower. PTL 5 reports the actual results indicating that the worked\nmicrostructure ratio is 5 % with annealing at 750 °C for 30 seconds, 20 % with annealing at 700 °C for 30 seconds, and\n50 % with annealing at 600 °C for 30 seconds. In this case, there is a problem that such low annealing temperatures\nlead to insufficient shape correction of rolling strips. Improperly-shaped steel sheets have a problem that would lead to\na lower stacking factor after worked into a motor core in a stacked fashion, a  non-uniform stress distribution when\nrotating at high speed as a rotor, and so on. There is another problem that the ratio of worked grains to recrystallized\ngrains varies greatly with the steel compositions and annealing temperatures, which makes it difficult to obtain stable\nproperties. Further, a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is generally subjected to final annealing using a continuous\nannealing furnace, which is usually maintained in an atmosphere containing at least several percent of hydrogen gas\nin order to reduce oxidation of surfaces of the steel sheet. To carry out low-temperature annealing at temperatures below\n700 °C in such a continuous annealing facility, there will be tremendous operational constraints, such as requirements\nof time-consuming switching of furnace temperature settings, replacement of the atmosphere in the furnace for avoiding\nhydrogen explosion, and so on.\n[0010]In view of the aforementioned technical background, the inventors of the present invention proposed in JP\n2007-186790 A (PTL 6) a high strength electrical steel sheet balancing the ability of shape correction of the steel sheet\nwith the ability of strengthening by non-recrystallized microstructures during final annealing, which steel sheet is obtained\nby adding Ti sufficiently and excessively in relation to C and N to a silicon steel with reduced C and N contents and\nthereby raising the recrystallization temperature of the silicon steel. This method still has a difficulty in that it may increase\nalloy cost due to a relatively high Ti content, cause variations in mechanical properties due to the remaining recrystallized\nmicrostructures, and so on.\nCITATION LIST\nPatent Literature\n[0011]\nPTL 1: JP 60-238421 A\nPTL 2: JP 62-112723 A\nPTL 3: JP 6-330255 A\nPTL 4: JP 2-008346 A\nPTL 5: JP 2005-113185 A\nPTL 6: JP 2007-186790 A\nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n(Technical Problem)\n[0012]As described above, some proposals have been made on high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheets.\nIn the proposals made to date, however, it has not been possible until now to manufacture, with the use of an ordinary\nfacility for manufacturing electrical steel sheets, such a high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet in an industrially\nstable manner with good yield and at low cost that has good magnetic properties in addition to high tensile strength and\nhigh fatigue strength, and furthermore, satisfy the quality requirements of steel sheet, such as those relating to surface\ndefects, internal defects, sheet shape or the like. Particularly, the high-strength electrical steel sheets that have so far\nbeen provided for rotors of high speed motors are in a situation where the resulting rotors will be subject to unavoidable\nheat generation due to their magnetic property, i.e., high iron loss at high frequency, which necessarily poses limitations\non the design specification of the motors.\n[0013]Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet at\nlow cost, having excellent magnetic properties and quality of steel sheet, and a method for manufacturing the same.\nSpecifically, an object of the present invention is to provide means for manufacturing such a non-oriented electrical steel\nsheet in an industrially stable manner and yet at low cost that has both a tensile strength of 650 MPa or more, desirably\n700 MPa or more, and good low iron loss properties at high frequency such that, for example, a steel material having a\nsheet thickness of 0.35 mm has a value of W\n10/400\n of 40 W/kg or lower, desirably 35 W/kg or lower.\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n(Solution to Problem)\n[0014]The inventors of the present invention made intensive studies on high-strength electrical steel sheets that can\nachieve the above-described objects at a high level and methods for manufacturing the same. As a result, the inventors\nhave revealed that the amount and ratio of Ti and C to be added to steel are deeply concerned with the balance between\nthe strength properties and the magnetic properties of an electrical steel sheet, and that a high-strength electrical steel\nsheet having excellent properties may be  manufactured in an stable manner and at low cost by optimizing the amount\nof precipitation of Ti carbides.\nThat is, the present invention relies upon the following findings:\n(A) The growth of crystal grains of an electrical steel sheet during final annealing may be inhibited by the presence\nof a relatively small amount of Ti carbides, whereby strengthening by refinement of crystal grains may be achieved.\n(B) The presence of excessive Ti carbides does not contribute to effective inhibition of the growth of crystal grains,\nbut rather has adverse effects such as causing more surface defects and internal defects, degrading quality of steel\nsheet, contributing to origins of fracture, and so on. To this extent, surface defects such as scabs and internal defects\nare significantly reduced by controlling the amount of Ti to be added to the steel within an appropriate range. On\nthe other hand, Ti nitrides are formed at higher temperatures than Ti carbides. Thus, they are less effective for\ninhibiting the growth of crystal grains and not useful for crystal grain refinement control intended by the present\ninvention. Therefore, in an approach for inhibiting the growth of crystal grains by controlling the amount of Ti carbides,\nit is desirable to reduce the N content in a stable manner. This is entirely different from the conventional approaches\nutilizing strengthening by precipitation, where the effects of C and N are dealt with in the same manner.\n(C) In a steel sheet with refined crystal grains, solute C has an effect of not only enhancing tensile strength, but also\nimproving fatigue properties essentially required for a rotor material rotating at high speed.\n(D) Major alloy components that are normally added for the purpose of reducing iron loss by increasing the electrical\nresistance of an electrical steel sheet are Si, Al and Mn. These three substitutional alloy elements also have an\neffect of implementing solid solution strengthening of steel. Accordingly, the balance between high strength and low\niron loss is effectively ensured on the basis of the solid solution strengthening by these elements. However, there\nis a  limit in adding these elements since excessive addition leads to embrittlement of steel and poses difficulty in\nmanufacturing steel. Si-based addition is desirable for satisfying the requirements of solid solution strengthening,\nlower iron loss and productivity in most efficient way.\n[0015]Based on these findings, the inventors of the present invention found that a properly balanced utilization of\nsolid solution strengthening with the use of the substitutional alloy elements mainly composed of Si, crystal grain refine-\nment with Ti carbides, and solid solution strengthening with an interstitial element of C may provide a non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet that has high strength, excellent fatigue properties under the conditions of use, and furthermore,\nexcellent magnetic properties and quality of steel sheet, without substantially adding extra constraints on manufacture\nof steel sheets or additional steps to the normal production of non-oriented electrical steel sheets, and also found a\nmethod necessary for manufacturing the same. As a result, the inventors accomplished the present invention.\n[0016]That is, the primary features of the present invention are as follows.\n(i) A non-oriented electrical steel sheet comprising, by mass%:\nSi: 5.0 % or less;\nMn: 2.0 % or less;\nAl: 2.0 % or less; and\nP: 0.05 % or less,\nin a range satisfying formula (1), and the steel sheet further comprising, by mass%:\nC: 0.008 % or more and 0.040 % or less;\nN: 0.003 % or less; and\nTi: 0.04 % or less,\nin a range satisfying formula (2), the balance being composed of Fe and incidental impurities: \n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nwhere Ti* = Ti - 3.4[N%], and\nthe [Si%], [Mn%], [Al%], [P%], [C%] and [N%] represent the contents (mass%) of the indicated elements,\nrespectively.\n[0017](ii) The non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (i) above, wherein the Si, Mn, Al and P contents are,\nby mass%,\nSi: more than 3.5 % but not more than 5.0 %,\nMn: 0.3 % or less,\nAl: 0.1 % or less, and\nP: 0.05 % or less.\n[0018](iii) The non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (i) or (ii) above, further comprising, by mass%, at least\none of:\nSb: 0.0005 % or more and 0.1 % or less;\nSn: 0.0005 % or more and 0.1 % or less;\nB: 0.0005 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nCa: 0.001 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nREM: 0.001 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nCo: 0.05 % or more and 5 % or less;\nNi: 0.05 % or more and 5 % or less; and\nCu: 0.2 % or more and 4 % or less.\n[0019](iv) A method for manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet, comprising:\nsubjecting a steel slab to soaking, where the steel slab is retained at a soaking temperature of 1000 °C to 1200 °C,\nthe steel slab containing, by mass%,\nSi: 5.0 % or less,\nMn: 2.0 % or less,\nAl: 2.0 % or less, and\nP: 0.05 % or less,\nin a range satisfying formula (1), and the steel slab further containing, by mass%,\nC: 0.008 % or more and 0.040 % or less,\nN: 0.003 % or less, and\nTi: 0.04 % or less,\nin a range satisfying formula (2);\nsubjecting the steel slab to subsequent hot rolling to obtain a hot-rolled steel material;\nthen subjecting the steel material to cold rolling or warm rolling once, or twice or more with intermediate annealing\nperformed therebetween, to be finished to a final sheet thickness; and\nsubjecting the steel material to final annealing, wherein prior to the final annealing, the steel material is subjected\nto heat treatment at least once where the steel material is retained at temperatures of 800 °C or higher and 950 °C\nor lower for 30 seconds or more, and subsequently to the final annealing at 700 °C or higher and 850 °C or lower: \n, where Ti* = Ti - 3.4[N%].\n[0020](v) The method for manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (iv) above, wherein the Si,\nMn, Al and P contents are, by mass%,\nSi: more than 3.5 % but not more than 5.0 %,\nMn: 0.3 % or less,\nAl: 0.1 % or less, and\nP: 0.05 % or less.\n[0021](vi) The method for manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet according to (iv) or (v) above, wherein\nthe steel slab further contains, by mass%, at least one of:\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nSb: 0.0005 % or more and 0.1 % or less;\nSn: 0.0005 % or more and 0.1 % or less;\nB: 0.0005 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nCa: 0.001 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nREM: 0.001 % or more and 0.01 % or less;\nCo: 0.05 % or more and 5 % or less;\nNi: 0.05 % or more and 5 % or less; and\nCu: 0.2 % or more and 4 % or less.\n(Advantageous Effect of Invention)\n[0022]According to the present invention, a non-oriented electrical steel sheet may be provided that is excellent in\nboth mechanical properties and  magnetic properties required for a rotor material of motors rotating at high speed, and\nthat has excellent quality of steel sheet in terms of scab, sheet shape, and so on.

Therefore, the present invention is applicable in the field of motors, such as drive\nmotors of electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles or servo motors of robots and machine tools, where demand for higher\nrotational speed is expected to grow in the future. Thus, the present invention has a high industrial value and makes a\nsignificant contribution to the industry.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\n[0023]The present invention will be further described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a graph illustrating the relationship between Ti content and tensile strength;\nFIG. 2 is a graph illustrating the relationship between Ti content and iron loss; and\nFIG. 3 is a graph illustrating the relationship between Ti content and surface scab defect rate.\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\n[0024]The experimental results underlying the present invention will be described in detail below.\nThat is, the inventors of the present invention investigated in detail how Ti, which is a major carbonitride forming element,\naffects the quality of steel sheet in terms of strengthening by precipitation, recrystallization, grain growth behavior, scabs,\nand so on. As a result, it was found that Ti has significantly different effects, in particular, when added so that the resulting\nTi content is equal to or less than a total content of C and N in atomic fraction, and has an optimum range of addition\nfor satisfying the requirements at a high level regarding high strength as well as magnetic properties and quality of  steel\nsheet. The major experimental results will be described below. The percentage \"%\" of each steel component represents\n\"mass%,\" unless otherwise specified.\n<Experiment 1>\n[0025]Steel samples, which have steel compositions mainly composed of silicon (Si): 4.0 % to 4.1 %, manganese\n(Mn): 0.03 % to 0.05 %, aluminum (Al): 0.001 % or less, phosphorus (P): 0.007 % to 0.009 %, and sulfur (S): 0.001 %\nto 0.002 %, containing substantially constant amounts of carbon (C): 0.024 % to 0.026 % and nitrogen (N): 0.001 % to\n0.002 %, and different amounts of titanium (Ti) in the range of 0.001 % to 0.36 %, were obtained by steelmaking in a\nvacuum melting furnace. These steel samples were heated to 1100 °C and then subjected to hot rolling to be finished\nto a thickness of 2.1 mm, respectively. Then, the steel samples were subjected to hot band annealing at 900 °C for 90\nseconds and further to cold rolling to be finished to a thickness of 0.35 mm, after which the occurrence of scab defects\non the surfaces of the steel sheets (scab size per unit area) was determined. Subsequently, the steel samples were\nsubjected to final annealing at 800 °C for 30 seconds and evaluated for their mechanical properties (by using JIS No. 5\ntensile test specimens cut parallel to the rolling direction) and magnetic properties (by using Epstein test specimens cut\nin the rolling direction and transverse direction, measuring iron loss W\n10/400\n with a magnetizing flux density of 1.0 T and\nfrequency of 400 Hz). The research results of tensile strength, magnetic property and occurrence of surface scab defect\nare depicted in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 as a function of Ti content, respectively.\n[0026]Firstly, as illustrated in FIG. 1, tensile strength increases with addition of Ti. However, it was found that this\neffect is less pronounced within a Ti content range indicated by \"A\" (Range A) in FIG. 1 where Ti content is smaller,\nwhile stable improvements in strength are observed within a Ti content range indicated by \"B\" (Range B) in the figure.\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nAdditionally, even further improvements in strength are achieved within a range indicated by \"C\" (Range C) in the figure\nwhere Ti content is higher. Upon observation of steel structure in these regions, it was found that in Range B, the steel\nstructure contains homogeneous microstructures with a crystal grain size of 10 mm or less, whereas in Range A, it\ninvolves crystal grains grown more than in  Range B, particularly, mixed-grain-size microstructures with partial grain\ngrowth. On the other hand, in Range C, the steel structure assumes a multi-phase of non-recrystallized grains and\nrecrystallized grains.\n[0027]FIG. 2 illustrates the relationship between Ti content and iron loss W\n10/400\n. While good iron loss properties are\nobtained in Range A with the lowest iron loss, as illustrated in FIG. 1, Range A shows lower strength levels. On the other\nhand, while high strength materials are obtained in Range C and D in FIG. 2, iron loss is also high in these ranges. In\ncontrast, Range B offers materials that have iron loss properties almost as good as in Range A, while yielding strength\nresults comparable to those obtained in Range C.\n[0028]On the other hand, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the scab defect rate starts to increase when Ti content exceeds 0.04\n%, and continues to rise up to around a point at which the equivalent ratio of elements of Ti to C and N is equal to 1,\nwhere a substantially constant rate of scab generation is reached. Assuming constant C and N contents, the amount of\nTi carbonitride precipitates continues to increase up to around a point at which this equivalent ratio of elements is equal\nto 1, and then remains constant. Thus, it is considered that the amount of Ti carbonitride precipitates is related to the\namount of scab generation.\nThese results revealed that by controlling Ti content within range B, it becomes possible to balance high strength and\nlow iron loss, while reducing scab defects that would otherwise cause a reduction in yield and a sheet fracture trouble\nand be directly linked to an increase in manufacturing cost. That is, it is advantageous to contain Ti in an amount of 0.04\n% or less in terms of reducing scab defects, provided that it is sufficient for forming a certain amount of Ti carbonitrides.\n[0029]In addition, as a result of further studies conducted with the same components except for the above-described\nsteel and N content and with varying N contents, it was also found that the lower limit of Ti content to which high strength\ncan be obtained increases with increasing N contents. Still further studies revealed that it is necessary to satisfy a relation\nof 0.008 ≤ Ti* (where Ti* = Ti - 3.4[N%]). From this, it is believed that since Ti carbides make a large contribution to\nenhancement of strength while Ti nitrides contribute less, control of Ti carbides is more important.\n[0030]These results revealed that by controlling Ti content at a level of Range B, it becomes possible to balance high\nstrength and low iron loss, while reducing scab defects that would otherwise cause a reduction in yield and a sheet\nfracture trouble and be directly linked to an increase in manufacturing cost.\n<Experiment 2>\n[0031]Then, to investigate details of the influence of Ti carbonitrides, steel samples having compositions shown in\nTable 1 were prepared by steelmaking in a vacuum melting furnace to obtain steel sheets, each having a sheet thickness\nof 0.35 mm, following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. C and N contents of steel samples were varied using\nsteel sample \"a,\" which has small C and N contents, as a reference. Steel samples \"c\" and \"d\" contain C and N so that\nthe total content thereof is within a predetermined range. The surface scab defect rate, iron loss and tensile strength of\nthe resulting samples are shown in Table 2. While steel samples \"b,\" \"c\" and \"d\" show an increase in strength in relation\nto steel sample \"a,\" comparing steel samples \"c\" and \"d\" having substantially the same total amount of C and N to\nevaluate the effect of addition of C and N, it can be seen that steel sample \"c\" having a lower N content has higher\nstrength. Upon observation of microstructures, it was found that the steel samples are listed as a > d > b > c in descending\norder of crystal grain size, as is the case with in descending order of tensile strength.\n[0032][Table 1]\n[0033][Table 2]\nTable 1\n(mass%)\nSteelSiMnAlPCNTi\na4.330.070.0005  0.010   0.0019  0.0021  0.0302\nb4.320.050.0010  0.010   0.0240  0.0009  0.0295\nc4.290.030.0007  0.010   0.0293  0.0009  0.0298\nd4.250.080.0018  0.020   0.0249  0.0052  0.0301\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0034]These samples were further investigated for their fatigue properties. Tests were conducted in a tension-to-\ntension mode with a stress ratio of 0.1 at a frequency of 20 Hz, where the fatigue limit strength is defined as a stress\nwhich allows a sample to survive 10 million stress amplitude cycles. The results thereof are also shown in Table 2. While\na tendency is observed that materials having a higher tensile strength TS possess a higher fatigue limit strength FS, the\nstrength ratio FS/TS differs for different materials. In this case, steel sample \"c\" gave the best result. On the other hand,\nsteel sample \"d\" does not improve so much in fatigue limit strength for its high tensile strength. Given these circumstances,\nand as a result of our detailed investigations of the microstructures of steel sample \"d,\" many precipitates, presumably\nTiN precipitates having a grain size of greater than 5 mm were scattered over the microstructures, and these precipitates\nwere estimated as contributing to origins of fatigue fracture. It should be noted here that nitrogen reacts with titanium at\nrelatively high temperatures of 1100 °C or higher and tends to precipitate as TiN coarsely. It was thus believed that TiN\ntends to provide origins of fatigue fracture and is less effective as compared to Ti carbides for inhibiting the growth of\ncrystal grains, which is one of the goals of the present invention.\n[0035]On the other hand, when comparing steel samples \"b\" and \"c,\" it was also found that steel sample \"c\" gives\nbetter results in terms of tensile strength and fatigue limit strength, and is particularly characterized by its relatively high\nfatigue limit strength and high strength ratio FS/TS. Since steel samples \"b\" and \"c\" have substantially the same Ti and\nN contents, they exhibit similar precipitation behavior of Ti nitrides and Ti carbides. It is  thus believed that the difference\nbetween them is attributed to the difference in the amount of solute carbon. Accordingly, it is estimated that the presence\nof solute carbon reduced the occurrence and propagation of cracks and increased fatigue limit strength by locking\ndislocations introduced during repeated stress cycles such as found in fatigue test. Therefore, it is also important to\nensure formation of solute carbon.\n[0036]Based on the above-described experimental results, the inventors of the present invention made further studies\non how these factors including Ti carbides, Ti nitrides and solute carbon, with the addition of a relatively small amount\nof Ti, affect the steel structure, quality of steel sheet surface, as well as mechanical properties and magnetic properties\nof steel sheets. As a result, the inventors discovered the rules comprehensively applicable to these factors and accom-\nplished the present invention.\n[0037]The present invention will now be described in detail below for each requirement.\nFirstly, the grounds for the limitations with regard to the major steel components are described.\nSteel of the present invention contains Si: 5.0 % or less, Mn: 2.0 % or less, Al: 2.0 % or less, and P: 0.05 % or less in\na range satisfying formula (1): \n[0038]An object of the present invention is to provide an electrical steel sheet having high strength and excellent\nmagnetic properties at low cost. To this end, it is necessary to achieve solid solution strengthening above a certain level\nby means of the above-described four major alloy components. Thus, it is important to specify the contents of the four\nmajor alloy components as described later, and to add these components to the steel so that the total amount of these\nalloy components is within a range satisfying the above formula (1), considering individual contributions to solid solution\nstrengthening. That is, if formula (1) gives a result less than 300, the strength of the resulting material is insufficient,\nwhereas if formula (1) gives a result more than 430, there are more troubles with sheet cracking at the time  of manufacture\nof steel sheets, leading to a deterioration in productivity and a significant increase in manufacturing cost.\n[0039]Next, the grounds for the limitations on the individual contents of the four major alloy components are described.\nSi ≤ 5.0 %\n[0040]Silicon (Si) is generally used as a deoxidizer and one of the major elements that are contained in a non-oriented\nTable 2\nSteel   W\n10/400\n (W/kg)\nTensile Strength \nTS (MPa)\nFatigue Limit \nStrength FS (MPa)\nStrength Ratio \nFS/TS\nSurface Scab \nDefect Rate (m/m\n2\n)\na26.96415350.830.000\nb33.07226300.870.003\nc32.57306650.910.003\nd31.06765400.800.004\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n10\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nelectrical steel sheet and have an effect of increasing the electrical resistance of steel to reduce its iron loss. Further,\nSi has high solid solution strengthening ability. That is, Si is an element that is positively added to the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet because it is capable of achieving higher tensile strength, higher fatigue strength and lower iron\nloss at the same time in a most balanced manner as compared to other solid-solution-strengthening elements, such as\nMn, Al or Ni, that are added to the non-oriented electrical steel sheet. To this end, it is advantageous to contain Si in\nsteel in an amount of 3.0 % or more, more preferably exceeding 3.5 %. However, above 5.0 %, toughness degradation\nwill be pronounced, which should necessitate highly-sophisticated control during sheet passage and rolling processes,\nresulting in lower productivity. Therefore, the upper limit of the Si content is to be 5.0 % or less.\nMn ≤ 2.0 %\n[0041]Manganese (Mn) is effective in improving hot shortness properties, and also has effects of increasing the\nelectrical resistance of steel to reduce its iron loss and enhancing the strength of steel by solid solution strengthening.\nThus, Mn is preferably contained in steel in an amount of 0.01 % or more. However, addition of Mn is less effective in\nimproving the strength of steel as compared to Si and excessive addition thereof leads to embrittlement of the resulting\nsteel. Therefore, the Mn content is to be 2.0 % or less.\nAl ≤ 2.0 %\n[0042]Aluminum (Al) is an element that is generally used in steel refining as a strong deoxidizer. Further, as is the\ncase with Si and Mn, Al also has effects of increasing the electrical resistance of steel to reduce its iron loss and enhancing\nthe strength of steel by solid solution strengthening. Therefore, Al is preferably contained in steel in an amount of 0.0001\n% or more. However, addition of Al is less effective in improving the strength of steel as  compared to Si and excessive\naddition thereof leads to embrittlement of the resulting steel. Therefore, the Al content is to be 2.0 % or less.\nP ≤ 0.05 %\n[0043]Phosphorus (P) is extremely effective in enhancing the strength of steel because it offers a significantly high\nsolid solution strengthening ability even when added in relatively small amounts. Thus, P is preferably contained in steel\nin an amount of 0.005 % or more. However, excessive addition of P leads to embrittlement of steel due to segregation,\ncausing intergranular cracking or a reduction in rollability. Therefore, the P content is limited to 0.05 % or less.\n[0044]Additionally, among these major alloy elements Si, Mn, Al and P, a Si-based alloy design is advantageous for\nbalancing solid solution strengthening/low iron loss and productivity in a most efficient way. That is, it is advantageous\nto contain Si in steel in an amount of more than 3.5 % for optimizing the balance of properties of the non-oriented electrical\nsteel sheet, where the contents of the remaining three elements are preferably controlled as follows: Mn: 0.3 % or less,\nAl: 0.1 % or less, and P: 0.05 % or less. The grounds for the limitations on the upper limit are as described above.\n[0045]In addition, C, N and Ti are also important elements in the present invention. This is because it is important to\ninhibit the growth of crystal grains during steel sheet annealing with the use of a proper amount of fine Ti carbides and\nto develop an ability of reinforcing crystal grain refinement. For this purpose, it is necessary to contain C: 0.008 % or\nmore and 0.040 % or less, N: 0.003 % or less, and Ti: 0.04 % or less in steel, in a range satisfying formula (2): \nwhere Ti* = Ti - 3.4[N%].\n0.008 % ≤ C ≤ 0.040 %\n[0046]Carbon (C) needs to be contained in steel in an amount of 0.008 % or more. That is, a carbon content of less\nthan 0.008 % makes it difficult to provide stable precipitation of fine Ti carbides and results in an insufficient amount of\nsolute C, in which case a further improvement in fatigue strength is no longer  possible. On the other hand, excessive\naddition of C leads to a deterioration in magnetic properties, while becoming a factor responsible for an increase in cost,\nsuch as making work hardening more pronounced during cold rolling and causing sheet fracture, forcing more rolling\ncycles due to an increased rolling load, and so on. Therefore, the upper limit of C is limited to 0.04 %.\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n11\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nN ≤ 0.003 %\n[0047]Nitrogen (N) forms nitrides with Ti, which are, however, formed at higher temperatures than Ti carbides. Thus,\nN is less effective in inhibiting the growth of crystal grains and not effective so much in refining crystal grains. Rather,\nN sometimes causes adverse effects such as providing origins of fatigue fracture. Therefore, N content is limited to\n0.003 % or less. Additionally, without limitation, the lower limit is preferably about 0.0005 % in terms of steelmaking\ndegassing ability and for avoiding a deterioration in productivity due to a long refining duration.\nTi ≤ 0.04 %\n[0048]Control of titanium (Ti) carbides is important in the present invention. Ti tends to form nitrides rather than\ncarbides at high temperatures. Thus, it is necessary to control the amount of Ti forming carbides. If the amount of Ti\nthat is capable of forming carbides is denoted as Ti*, Ti* is represented as the Ti content minus the atom equivalent with\nN, namely: \nTo allow the added Ti to precipitate as Ti carbides for enhancing the strength of steel, while inhibiting the growth of\ncrystal grains for preventing an increase in iron loss of the steel, it is necessary to use a proper amount of C and satisfy\nTi* ≥ 0.008. On the other hand, if Ti content is increased in relation to C content, there is a reduction in the amount of\nsolute C, in which case a further improvement in fatigue strength is no longer possible. Therefore, it is also necessary\nto satisfy Ti* < 1.2[C%] at the same time.\n[0049]In addition, if Ti content exceeds 0.04 %, as previously described with reference to FIG. 3, more scab defects\nwill occur and the quality of steel sheet and yield will be reduced, resulting in an increase in cost. Therefore, the upper\nlimit of Ti content is to be 0.04 %.\n[0050]The present invention may also contain elements other than the aforementioned elements without impairing\nthe effects of the invention. For example, the present invention may contain: antimony (Sb) and tin (Sn), each of which\nhas an effect of improving magnetic properties of steel, in the range of 0.0005 % to 0.1 %; boron (B), which has an effect\nof enhancing grain boundary strength of steel, in the range of 0.0005 % to 0.01 %; Ca and REM, each of which has an\neffect of controlling the form of oxide and sulfide and improving magnetic properties of steel, in the range of 0.001 % to\n0.01 %; Co and Ni, each of which has an effect of improving magnetic flux density of steel, in the range of 0.05 % to 5\n%; and Cu, which is expected to provide strengthening by precipitation by means of aging precipitation, in the range of\n0.2 % to 4 %, respectively.\n[0051]The grounds for the limitations with regard to a manufacturing method according to the present invention will\nnow be described below. In the present invention, the manufacturing process from steelmaking to cold rolling may be\nperformed in accordance with methods commonly used for manufacturing general non-oriented electrical steel sheets.\nFor example, steel, which was prepared by steelmaking and refined with predetermined components in a converter or\nelectric furnace, may be subjected to continuous casting or blooming after ingot casting to obtain steel slabs, which in\nturn may be subjected to process steps, including hot rolling, optional hot band annealing, cold rolling, final annealing,\ninsulating coating application and baking, and so on to manufacture steel sheets. In these steps, the conditions for\nproperly controlling the precipitation state will be described below. It should be noted that hot band annealing may\noptionally be carried out after the hot rolling, and that the cold rolling may be performed once, or twice or more with\nintermediate annealing performed therebetween.\n[0052]The steel slabs composed of the aforementioned chemical compositions are to be subjected to hot rolling at a\nslab heating temperature of 1000 °C or higher to 1200 °C or lower. That is, if the slab heating temperature is below 1000\n°C, it is not possible to achieve an effect of inhibiting the growth of crystal grains during final annealing in a sufficient\nmanner due to the precipitation and growth of Ti carbides during slab heating. Alternatively, if the slab heating temperature\nis above 1200 °C, this is not  only disadvantageous in terms of cost, but also causes slab deformation due to a reduction\nin strength at high temperature, which interferes with, e.g., extraction of the steel slabs from the heating furnace, resulting\nin lower operability. Therefore, the slab heating temperature is to be within the range of 1000 °C to 1200 °C. Additionally,\nthe hot rolling itself is not limited to a particular type and may be performed under the conditions of, for example, hot\nrolling finishing temperature in the range of 700 °C to 950 °C and coiling temperature of 750 °C or lower.\n[0053]Then, the resulting hot rolled steel materials are subjected to optional hot band annealing and cold rolling or\nwarm rolling once, or twice or more with intermediate annealing performed therebetween to be finished to a final sheet\nthickness before final annealing. Prior to the final annealing, it is important to subject the steel materials to heat treatment\nat least once where the steel materials are retained at temperatures of 800 °C or higher and 950 °C or lower for 30\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n12\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nseconds or more. This heat treatment may allow precipitation of Ti carbides in microstructures prior to the final annealing\nand thereby inhibit the growth of crystal grains during final annealing.\n[0054]That is, if the above-described heat treatment is performed at temperatures below 800 °C, the resulting pre-\ncipitation may be insufficient, while above 950 °C, the effect of inhibiting the growth of crystal grains during final annealing\nwould be insufficient due to the growth of precipitates.\n[0055]Additionally, the aforementioned heat treatment is preferably performed in combination with either hot band\nannealing or intermediate annealing prior to the final annealing.\n[0056]The subsequent final annealing may be performed at 700 °C or higher and 850 °C or lower to thereby control\nthe microstructure of recrystallized grains into a homogeneous and fine state, providing an electrical steel sheet having\nhigh strength and excellent magnetic properties. If the final annealing is performed at temperatures below 700 °C, the\nresulting recrystallization is insufficient, while above 850 °C, crystal grains are prone to grow even when applying the\npresent invention, resulting in a reduction in strength of the products. Following this final annealing, the steel materials\nare subjected to processes for applying and baking insulating coating thereon to obtain final products.\n[Example 1]\n[0057]Steel samples having compositions shown in Table 3 were obtained by steelmaking in a vacuum melting\nfurnace, heated to 1100 °C, and then subjected to hot rolling to be a thickness of 2.1 mm. Then, the samples were\nsubjected to hot band annealing at 900 °C for 90 seconds and further to cold rolling to be finished to a thickness of 0.35\nmm. At this moment, an evaluation was made of the occurrence of scab defects on the surfaces of the steel sheets,\nusing the scab size per unit area as a reference. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to final annealing for 30\nseconds under two different conditions at 750 °C and 800 °C, respectively. Then, test specimens were cut parallel to\nthe rolling direction from the steel sheet samples thus obtained for tensile test and fatigue test. In addition, the magnetic\nproperties were evaluated based on the iron loss with a magnetizing flux density of 1.0 T and frequency of 400 Hz of\nthe Epstein test specimens that were cut from the samples in the rolling direction and transverse direction, respectively.\nThe evaluation results are shown in Table 4.\n[0058][Table 3]\n[0059][Table 4]\nTable 3\n(mass \n%)\nSteelSiMnAlPCNTi\nFormula \n(1)\nTi*Remarks\n14.08   0.08   0.0010   0.012   0.0250   0.0015   0.0010354-0.0041\nComparative \nExample\n24.10   0.05   0.0010   0.010   0.0247   0.0013   0.01893540.0145\nInventive \nExample\n34.05   0.04   0.0004   0.018   0.0251   0.0016   0.03493540.0295\nInventive \nExample\n44.08   0.05   0.0015   0.011   0.0245   0.0012   0.06413530.0600\nComparative \nExample\n54.02   0.04   0.0020   0.017   0.0258   0.0017   0.11643510.1106\nComparative \nExample\n64.07   0.08   0.0019   0.014   0.0260   0.0019   0.16303540.1565\nComparative \nExample\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n13\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTable 4\nSteel\nSurface \nScab Defect \nRate\n800 °C Annealing\n750 °C Annealing\nRemarks\nW\n10/400\nTensile \nStrength\nFatigue Limit \nStrength\nStrength Ratio   W\n10/400\nTensile \nStrength\nFatigue Limit \nStrength\nStrength Ratio\n(m/m\n2\n)\n(W/kg)\nTS (MPa)\nFS (MPa)\nFS/TS\n(W/kg)\nTS\n(MPa)\nFS (MPa)\nFS/TS\n1\n0.000\n27.4\n634\n540\n0.85\n33.4\n707\n570\n0.81\nComparative \nExample\n2\n0.000\n31.5\n710\n635\n0.89\n33.9\n727\n650\n0.89\nInventive \nExample\n3\n0.005\n33.7\n715\n650\n0.91\n34.6\n731\n665\n0.91\nInventive \nExample\n4\n0.159\n42.7\n722\n600\n0.83\n44.4\n737\n620\n0.84\nComparative \nExample\n5\n0.189\n46.5\n726\n560\n0.77\n48.3\n744\n575\n0.77\nComparative \nExample\n6\n0.211\n48.0\n734\n565\n0.77\n51.0\n750\n580\n0.77\nComparative \nExample\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n14\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0060]It can be seen from Table 4 that Steel Sample No. 1, which has a Ti* value out of the scope of the present\ninvention, exhibits significantly different properties depending on the final annealing temperatures, which is considered\nproblematic in terms of quality control. On the other hand, steel samples containing a proper amount of Ti show smaller\ndifference in their properties depending on the final annealing temperatures, yielding high tensile strength in a stable\nmanner. However, as compared to Steel Sample No. 2 and 3 having steel compositions within the range specified by\nthe present invention, Steel Sample No. 4, 5 and 6, each having a Ti content out of the scope of the present invention,\nexhibit not so high fatigue limit strength for their high tensile strength and have inferior scab rate and magnetic properties.\n[Example 2]\n[0061]Steel samples having compositions shown in Table 5 were obtained by steelmaking in a vacuum melting\nfurnace, heated to 1050 °C, and then subjected to hot rolling to be a thickness of 2.1 mm. Then, the samples were\nsubjected to hot band annealing at 850 °C for 120 seconds and further to cold rolling to be finished to a thickness of\n0.35 mm. At this moment, an evaluation was made of the occurrence of scab defects on the surfaces of the steel sheets,\nusing the scab size per unit area as a reference. Subsequently, the steel samples were subjected to final annealing at\n800 °C for 30 seconds. Then, test specimens were cut parallel to the rolling direction from the steel sheet samples thus\nobtained for tensile test and fatigue test. In addition, the magnetic properties were evaluated based on the iron loss with\na magnetizing flux density of 1.0 T and frequency of 400 Hz of the Epstein test specimens that were cut from the samples\nin the rolling direction and transverse direction, respectively. The results thereof are also shown in Table 6.\nAdditionally, Steel Sample No. 18, which does not satisfy the relation of formula (1) specified by the present invention,\nexperienced sheet fracture during cold rolling, and so was not subjected to the subsequent evaluation process.\n[0062][Table 5]\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n15\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTable 5\n(mass%)\nSteel\nSi\nMn\nAl\nP\nC\nN\nTi\nOthers\nFormula (1)\nTi*\nRemarks\n7\n3.05\n0.15\n0.3500  0.018   0.0165  0.0014  0.0174\n-\n284\n0.0126   Comparative Example\n8\n3.75\n0.08\n0.0010  0.019   0.0043  0.0015  0.0172\n-\n329\n0.0121   Comparative Example\n9\n3.78\n0.05\n0.0008  0.014   0.0159  0.0017  0.0166\n-\n329\n0.0108\nInventive Example\n10\n4.01\n0.04\n0.0001  0.015   0.0135  0.0013  0.0154\n-\n349\n0.0109\nInventive Example\n11\n4.01\n0.04\n0.0004  0.015   0.0320  0.0016  0.0148\n-\n349\n0.0093\nInventive Example\n12\n4.05\n0.05\n0.0004  0.013   0.0572  0.0016  0.0166\n-\n351\n0.0111   Comparative Example\n13\n4.03\n0.01\n0.0004  0.001   0.0175  0.0041  0.0168\n-\n343\n0.0027   Comparative Example\n14\n4.82\n0.04\n1.0300  0.018   0.0158  0.0016  0.0188\n-\n419\n0.0133\nInventive Example\n15\n3.02\n0.88\n0.7000  0.010   0.0289  0.0016  0.0333\n-\n317\n0.0278\nInventive Example\n16\n3.55\n0.59\n1.2100  0.010   0.0294  0.0021  0.0328\n-\n344\n0.0256\nInventive Example\n17\n4.30\n0.11\n0.1800  0.012   0.0285  0.0025  0.0322\n-\n380\n0.0236\nInventive Example\n18\n4.60\n0.59\n1.2100  0.010   0.0296  0.0011  0.0311\n-\n454\n0.0293   Comparative Example\n19\n4.03\n0.15\n0.0005  0.010   0.0144  0.0009  0.0244    Sb: 0.015\n350\n0.0213\nInventive Example\n20\n4.11\n0.08\n0.0009  0.011   0.0167  0.0021  0.0217    Sn: 0.043\n356\n0.0145\nInventive Example\n21\n4.30\n0.18\n0.2530  0.007   0.0145  0.0009  0.0191\nB: 0.003\n382\n0.0160\nInventive Example\n22\n4.25\n0.09\n0.2310  0.018   0.0181  0.0011  0.0155    Ca: 0.003\n381\n0.0117\nInventive Example\n23\n4.22\n0.15\n0.0830  0.015   0.0226  0.0016  0.0185   REM: 0.004\n372\n0.0130\nInventive Example\n24\n3.98\n0.25\n0.2250  0.013   0.0284  0.0018  0.0355\nCo: 0.25\n358\n0.0293\nInventive Example\n25\n4.05\n0.20\n0.2840  0.016   0.0133  0.0015  0.0211\nNi: 0.15\n367\n0.0160\nInventive Example\n26\n3.87\n0.18\n0.2760  0.011   0.0336  0.0013  0.0347\nCu: 0.22\n348\n0.0302\nInventive Example\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n16\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0063][Table 6]\n[0064]It can be seen from Table 6 that each of the steel sheets according to the present invention exhibits less scabs,\nTable 6\nSteel\nSurface Scab \nDefect Rate \n(m/m\n2\n)\nW\n10/400\n (W/kg)\nTensile \nStrength TS \n(MPa)\nFatigue Limit \nStrength FS \n(MPa)\nStrength Ratio \nFS/TS\nRemarks\n70.00128.66255100.82\nComparative \nExample\n80.00032.76735350.79\nComparative \nExample\n90.00134.56856240.91\nInventive \nExample\n100.00532.27086310.89\nInventive \nExample\n110.00531.27056500.92\nInventive \nExample\n120.23038.76945750.93\nComparative \nExample\n130.11036.87015400.77\nComparative \nExample\n140.00528.87797150.92\nInventive \nExample\n150.03534.56686070.91\nInventive \nExample\n160.02633.37036450.92\nInventive \nExample\n170.03933.57356800.93\nInventive \nExample\n18-----\nComparative \nExample\n190.00331.97016200.88\nInventive \nExample\n200.00431.27076350.90\nInventive \nExample\n210.00633.47336400.87\nInventive \nExample\n220.00331.67296400.88\nInventive \nExample\n230.00332.07216330.88\nInventive \nExample\n240.00733.37236450.89\nInventive \nExample\n250.00534.17186250.87\nInventive \nExample\n260.00833.57066080.86\nInventive \nExample\n\nEP 2 679 695 A1\n17\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\ngood iron loss properties and high tensile strength, as well as high fatigue limit strength.\nClaims\n1.A non-oriented electrical steel sheet comprising, by mass%:\nSi: 5.0 % or less;\nMn: 2.0 % or less;\nAl: 2.0 % or less;

On the whole, there is a tendency that, if the temperature of the finish annealing is increased, the number density of sulfide decreases even in the same material. This is conceivably because sulfide coarsens during the finish annealing. Then, when sulfide coarsens, the deterrent against the growth of crystal grains is weakened. This conception also applies to the result of the case when the finish annealing was performed at 1000°C in Material symbol B.

Recently in particular, as a motor to be used for an electric vehicle or the like, a demand for a\nsmall-sized high-power motor has been high. Such an electric vehicle motor has been designed to make high-speed\nrotation possible to thereby obtain high torque.\n[0003]A high-speed rotation motor has also been used for a machine tool and an electrical apparatus such as a\nvacuum cleaner. The outer shape of a high-speed rotation motor for an electric vehicle is larger than that of a high-speed\nrotation motor for an electrical apparatus. Further, as a high-speed rotation motor for an electric vehicle, a DC brushless\nmotor has been mainly used. In a DC brushless motor, magnets are embedded in the vicinity of an outer periphery of\na rotor. In the above structure, the width of a bridge portion in an outer periphery portion of the rotor (the width between\nmagnets from the most outer periphery of the rotor to a steel sheet) is extremely narrow, which is 1 to 2 mm, depending\non a place. Therefore, a high-strength steel sheet has been required for a high-speed rotation motor for an electric\nvehicle rather than a conventional non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0004]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet is disclosed in which Mn and Ni are added to Si to achieve solid solution\nstrengthening in Patent Literature 1. However, it is not possible to obtain sufficient strength even by the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet. Further, due to the addition of Mn and Ni, its toughness is likely to be reduced, and sufficient\nproductivity and a sufficient yield cannot be obtained. Further, the prices of alloys to be added are high. In recent years\nin particular, the price of Ni has suddenly risen due to a worldwide demand balance.\n[0005]Non-oriented electrical steel sheets are disclosed in which carbonitride is dispersed in a steel to achieve strength-\nening in Patent Literatures 2 and 3. However, it is not possible to obtain sufficient strength even by the non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheets.\n[0006]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet is disclosed in which Cu precipitates are used to achieve strengthening\nin Patent Literature 4. However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient strength. For obtaining sufficient strength, annealing at\nhigh temperature is required to be performed in order to once solid-dissolve Cu. However, when the annealing at high\ntemperature is performed, crystal grains coarsen. That is, even though precipitation strengthening by Cu precipitates is\nobtained, by the coarsening of crystal grains, strength decreases and thus sufficient strength cannot be obtained. Further,\ndue to the synergistic effect of precipitation strengthening and coarsening of crystal grains, fracture elongation significantly\ndecreases.\n[0007]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet is disclosed in which suppression of the coarsening of crystal grains in\nPatent Literature 4 is intended in Patent Literature 5. In the technique, C, Nb, Zr, Ti, V, and so are contained. However,\nat 150°C to 200°C, being a heat generation temperature range of a motor, carbide precipitates finely and magnetic aging\nis likely to occur.\n[0008]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet is disclosed in which by precipitates of Al and N, achievement of making\ncrystal grains fine and precipitation strengthening by Cu is intended in Patent Literature 6. However, Al is contained in\nlarge amounts and thus it is difficult to sufficiently suppress the growth of crystal grains. Further, when an N content is\nincreased, a cast defect is likely to occur.\n[0009]A non-oriented electrical steel sheet containing Cu is disclosed in Patent Literature 7.

As a result, it was\nfound that the relationship between a S content and a Mn content is made appropriate and a content of sulfide having\na predetermined size is made appropriate, thereby making it possible to finely keep crystal grains even if annealing is\nperformed at a high temperature. In this case, an element which causes magnetic aging is not needed.\n[0015]Here, there will be explained an experiment leading to the present invention. Hereinafter, \"%\" being the unit of\na content means \"mass%.\"\n[0016]In the experiment, first, steels each containing C: 0.002%, Si: 3.2%, Mn: 0.20%, Al: 0.7%, N: 0.002%, and Cu:\n1.5%, and further S having a content listed in Table 1, in which a balance is composed of Fe and inevitable impurities,\n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nwere melted in a vacuum melting furnace in a laboratory, and a steel billet (slab) was made from each of the steels. In\nTable 1, [Mn] represents a Mn content (0.20%) and [S] represents a S content. Then, each of the steel billets was heated\nat 1100°C for 60 minutes and was subjected to hot rolling immediately, whereby hot-rolled sheets each having a thickness\nof 2.0 mm were obtained. Thereafter, each of the hot-rolled sheets was subjected to hot-rolled sheet annealing at 1050°C\nfor one minute, pickling, and one time of cold rolling, whereby cold-rolled sheets each having a thickness of 0.35 mm\nwere obtained. Subsequently, each of the cold-rolled sheets was subjected to finish annealing at 800°C to 1000°C for\n30 seconds. The temperature of the finish annealing is listed in Table 1.\n[0017]Then, a number density of sulfide in each of obtained non-oriented electrical steel sheets was measured. At\nthis time, an object to be measured was one having a circle-equivalent diameter of not less than 0.1 mm nor more than\n1.0 mm. Further, a yield stress, a fracture elongation, and a core loss were also measured. As the core loss, a core loss\nW10/400 was measured. Here, the core loss W10/400 is a core loss under the condition of frequency of 400 Hz and a\nmaximum magnetic flux density of 1.0 T. These results are also listed in Table 1.\n[0018][Table 1]\n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n5\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nTABLE 1\nMATERIAL \nSYMBOL\nS CONTENT \n(MASS%)\n[Mn]   /\n[S]\nTEMPERATURE \nOF FINISH \nANNEALING (°C)\nNUMBER \nDENSITY OF \nSULFIDE \n(PIECES/mm\n2\n)\nYIELD \nSTRESS \n(MPa)\nFRACTURE \nELONGATION \n(%)\nCORE \nLOSS \nW10/400 \n(W/kg)\nEVALUATION\nREMARKS\nA\n0.003\n66.7\n900\n1.1\n3\n10\n3\n674\n8\n24.2\nPOOR\nLOW YIELD \nSTRESS AND \nLOW \nFRACTURE \nELONGATION\n950\n5.7\n3\n10\n2\n641\n3\n20.5\nPOOR\nLOW YIELD \nSTRESS AND \nLOW \nFRACTURE \nELONGATION\n1000\n8.6\n3\n10\n505\n1\n19.6\nPOOR\nLOW YIELD \nSTRESS AND \nLOW \nFRACTURE \nELONGATION\nB\n0.006\n33.3\n900\n7.8\n3\n10\n4\n723\n18\n30.5\nGOOD\nGOOD\n950\n1.2\n3\n10\n4\n728\n15\n27.6\nGOOD\nGOOD\n1000\n5.8\n3\n10\n3\n713\n9\n25.6\nPOOR\nLOW \nFRACTURE \nELONGATION\nC\n0.008\n25\n900\n3.2\n3\n10\n5\n768\n22\n31.8\nGOOD\nGOOD\n950\n6.5\n3\n10\n4\n776\n18\n28.3\nGOOD\nGOOD\n1000\n2.4\n3\n10\n4\n784\n15\n25.3\nGOOD\nGOOD\nD\n0.019\n10.5\n900\n5.3\n3\n10\n5\n821\n25\n33.4\nGOOD\nGOOD\n950\n1.2\n3\n10\n5\n845\n22\n30.1\nGOOD\nGOOD\n1000\n6.6\n3\n10\n4\n875\n19\n29.3\nGOOD\nGOOD\n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n6\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n(continued)\nMATERIAL \nSYMBOL\nS CONTENT \n(MASS%)\n[Mn]   /\n[S]\nTEMPERATURE \nOF FINISH \nANNEALING (°C)\nNUMBER \nDENSITY OF \nSULFIDE \n(PIECES/mm\n2\n)\nYIELD \nSTRESS \n(MPa)\nFRACTURE \nELONGATION \n(%)\nCORE \nLOSS \nW10/400 \n(W/kg)\nEVALUATION\nREMARKS\nE\n0.025\n8\n900\n6.7\n3\n10\n7\n834\n8\n55.7\nPOOR\nPOOR CORE \nLOSS AND LOW \nFRACTURE \nELONGATION\n950\n9.8\n3\n10\n6\n830\n23\n40.6\nPOOR\nPOOR CORE \nLOSS\n1000\n2.4\n3\n10\n6\n815\n25\n39.6\nPOOR\nPOOR CORE \nLOSS\n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n7\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0019]An listed in Table 1, in Material symbols B, C, and D each having the value of [Mn]/[S] being not less than 10\nnor more than 50, a good property was obtained. However, even in Material symbol B, in the case where the finish\nannealing was performed at 1000°C, the number density of sulfide was low and the fracture elongation was low. On the\nwhole, there is a tendency that, if the temperature of the finish annealing is increased, the number density of sulfide\ndecreases even in the same material. This is conceivably because sulfide coarsens during the finish annealing. Then,\nwhen sulfide coarsens, the deterrent against the growth of crystal grains is weakened. This conception also applies to\nthe result of the case when the finish annealing was performed at 1000°C in Material symbol B. That is, it is conceivable\nthat in the example, the temperature of the finish annealing was 1000°C, which was high, and thus sulfide coarsened,\nthe number density of sulfide decreased, and the growth of crystal grains was not suppressed sufficiently.\n[0020]On the other hand, in Material symbol A having the value of [Mn]/[S] being greater than 50, the fracture elongation\nwas low and the yield stress was low. This is conceivably because [Mn]/[S] was high, and thus the number density of\nsulfide was low and the growth of crystal grains advanced.\n[0021]Further, in Material symbol E having the value of [Mn]/[S] being less than 10, the core loss was high significantly.\nThis is conceivably because [Mn]/[S] was low, and thus the number density of sulfide was high and the growth of crystal\ngrains was suppressed significantly. Further, in the case where the temperature of the finish annealing was 900°C, the\ncore loss was high and further the fracture elongation was low. This is conceivably because the number density of sulfide\nwas extremely high, and thus not only the growth of crystal grains but also recrystallization was inhibited.\n[0022]From the above experimental result, it is said that the S content, [Mn]/[S], and the number density of sulfide\nare each made to fall within a predetermined range, and thereby it is possible to obtain a high-strength non-oriented\nelectrical steel sheet excellent in all the core loss, strength, and ductility. Such a property excellent in balance is a\nproperty that has not been obtained in a conventional steel sheet utilizing carbonitride, or steel sheet having only Cu\nadded thereto simply.\n[0023]Next, reasons for limiting the numerical values in the present invention will be explained.\n[0024]C is effective for making crystal grains fine, but when a temperature of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet\nbecomes 200°C or so, C forms carbide to deteriorate a core loss. For example, when used for a high-speed rotation\nmotor for an electric vehicle, a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is likely to reach this level of temperature. Then, when\na C content is greater than 0.010%, such magnetic aging is significant. Thus, the C content is 0.010% or less, and is\nmore preferably 0.005% or less.\n[0025]Si is effective for a reduction in eddy current loss. Si is effective also for solid solution strengthening. However,\nwhen a Si content is less than 2.0%, these effects are insufficient. On the other hand, when the Si content is greater\nthan 4.0%, cold rolling during manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is likely to be difficult to be performed.\nThus, the Si content is not less than 2.0% nor more than 4.0%.\n[0026]Mn reacts with S to form sulfide. In the present invention, crystal grains are controlled by sulfide, so that Mn is\nan important element. When a Mn content is less than 0.05%, fixation of S is insufficient to cause hot shortness. On the\nother hand, when the Mn content is greater than 0.50%, it is difficult to sufficiently suppress growth of crystal grains.\nThus, the Mn content is not less than 0.05% nor more than 0.50%.\n[0027]Al is effective for a reduction in eddy current loss and solid solution strengthening, similarly to Si. Further, Al\nalso exhibits an effect of causing nitride to coarsely precipitate to make nitride harmless. However, when an Al content\nis less than 0.2%, these effects are insufficient. On the other hand, when the Al content is greater than 3.0%, cold rolling\nduring manufacturing a non-oriented electrical steel sheet is likely to be difficult to be performed. Thus, the Al content\nis not less than 0.2% nor more than 3.0%.\n[0028]N forms nitride such as TiN to deteriorate a core loss. Particularly, in the case where a N content is greater\nthan 0.005%, deterioration of a core loss is significant. Thus, the nitrogen content is 0.005% or less.\n[0029]Cu improves strength through precipitation strengthening. However, when a Cu content is less than 0.5%,\nalmost all the content of Cu is solid-dissolved and thus the effect of precipitation strengthening cannot be obtained. On\nthe other hand, even when the Cu content is greater than 3.0%, the effect is saturated and an effect measuring up to\nthe content cannot be obtained. Thus, the Cu content is not less than 0.5% nor more than 3.0%.\n[0030]S reacts with Mn to form sulfide. In the present invention, crystal grains are controlled by sulfide, so that S is\nan important element. When a S content is less than 0.005%, the effect cannot be obtained sufficiently. On the other\nhand, even when the S content is greater than 0.030%, the effect is saturated and an effect measuring up to the content\ncannot be obtained. Further, as the S content is increased, hot shortness is more likely to occur. Thus, the S content is\nnot less than 0.005% nor more than 0.030%.\n[0031]In the present invention, [Mn]/[S] is an important parameter for obtaining a good yield stress, a good fracture\nelongation, and a good core loss. When [Mn]/[S] is greater than 50, the effect of suppressing growth of crystal grains is\ninsufficient and a yield stress and a fracture elongation decrease. On the other hand, when [Mn]/[S] is less than 10, a\nfracture elongation decreases significantly and a core loss deteriorates significantly. Thus, [Mn]/[S] is not less than 10\nnor more than 50. That is, an expression (1) is established where a Mn content is represented as [Mn] and a S content\nis represented as [S]. \n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n8\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n[0032]Ni is an effective element capable of achieving a high strength of a steel sheet without embrittling it so much.\nBut, Ni is expensive and thus is preferably contained according to need. In the case of Ni being contained, for obtaining\nthe sufficient effect, the content is preferably 0.5% or more and is preferably 3.0% or less in consideration of its cost.\nFurther, Ni also has an effect of suppressing scabs caused by Cu being contained. For obtaining this effect, the Ni\ncontent is preferably 1/2 or more of a Cu content.\n[0033]Further, Sn has an effect of improving a texture and suppressing nitridation and oxidation during annealing.\nParticularly, there is a significant effect of compensating a magnetic flux density, which is decreased due to Cu being\ncontained, by improving the texture. For obtaining this effect, Sn may be contained to fall within a range of not less than\n0.01% nor more than 0.10%.\n[0034]Further, as for other trace elements, adding them because of various purposes in addition to their amount\ninevitably contained does not impair the effect of the present invention at all. Inevitable contents of these trace elements\neach are normally about 0.005% or less, but about 0.01% or more may be added for various purposes. Also in this case,\nit is possible to contain 0.5% or less of one or more of Ti, Nb, V, Zr, B, Bi, Mo, W, Sn, Sb, Mg, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, and REM\nin total in view of the cost and magnetic property.\n[0035]Next, the number density of sulfide will be explained. As is clear from the above-described experimental result,\nas for the number density of sulfide having a circle-equivalent diameter of not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 1.0 mm,\nan appropriate range exists in terms of a fracture elongation and a core loss. When the above number density is less\nthan 1.0310\n4\n pieces/mm\n2\n, sulfide is insufficient to thereby make it impossible to sufficiently suppress growth of crystal\ngrains, and although a good core loss can be obtained, a fracture elongation decreases extremely. On the other hand,\nwhen the above number density is greater than 1.0310\n6\n pieces/mm\n2\n, growth of crystal grains is suppressed excessively\nand a core loss deteriorates extremely. Further, recrystallization is sometimes suppressed, and in this case, not only\nthe core loss but also a fracture elongation deteriorates. Thus, the number density of sulfide having a circle-equivalent\ndiameter of not less than 0.1 mm nor more than 1.0 mm is not less than 1.0310\n4\n pieces/mm\n2\n nor more than 1.0310\n6\npieces/mm\n2\n.\n[0036]In the case when these conditions are satisfied, for example, a yield stress is likely to be 700 MPa or more,\nand a fracture elongation is likely to be 10% or more. Further, in the case when the preferable conditions are satisfied,\nthe fracture elongation is likely to be 12% or more. Further, for example, a recrystallization area ratio is likely to be 50%\nor more, and when the thickness of a steel sheet is represented as t (mm), a core loss W10/400 is likely to be 1003t or less.\n[0037]Next, there will be explained a manufacturing method of a high-strength non-oriented electrical steel sheet\naccording to an embodiment of the present invention.\n[0038]In the present embodiment, a slab having the above-described composition is first heated at 1150°C to 1250°C\nor so and is subjected to hot rolling, and thereby a hot-rolled sheet is made to then be coiled. Then, the hot-rolled sheet\nis subjected to cold rolling while being uncoiled, and thereby a cold-rolled sheet is made to then be coiled. Thereafter,\nfinish annealing is performed. Then, an insulating film is formed on the front surface of a steel sheet obtained in this\nmanner. That is, the manufacturing method according to the present embodiment is based on a substantially well-known\nmanufacturing method of a non-oriented electrical steel sheet.\n[0039]The condition of each treatment is not limited in particular, but preferable ranges exist as described below. For\nexample, a finishing temperature of the hot rolling is preferably 1000°C or higher and a coiling temperature is preferably\n650°C or lower, and both of the temperatures are preferably determined appropriately according to the contents of Mn,\nS, and Cu. This is to obtain the above-described number density of sulfide. If a finishing temperature is too low or a\ncoiling temperature is too high, fine MnS sometimes precipitates excessively. In this case, there is sometimes a case\nthat growth of crystal grains during the finish annealing is suppressed excessively to thereby make it impossible to obtain\na good core loss.\n[0040]A temperature of the finish annealing is preferably approximately 800°C to 1100°C, and its period of time is\npreferably shorter than 600 seconds. Further, in the finish annealing, continuous annealing is preferably performed.\n[0041]In terms of improving a magnetic flux density, hot-rolled sheet annealing is preferably performed before the\ncold rolling. Its condition is not limited in particular, but the hot-rolled sheet annealing is preferably performed in a range\nof 1000°C to 1100°C for 30 seconds or longer. The hot-rolled sheet annealing performed in the temperature range makes\nit possible to moderately grow MnS in the hot-rolled sheet and to decrease variation in the degree of MnS precipitation\nin the longitudinal direction. As a result, a property stable in the longitudinal direction can be obtained even after the\nfinish annealing. When the temperature of the hot-rolled sheet annealing is lower than 1000°C, or its period of times is\nshorter than 30 seconds, these effects are small. On the other hand, when the temperature of the hot-rolled sheet\nannealing is greater than 1100°C, part of sulfide is solid-dissolved and a crystal grain diameter after the finish annealing\nis too fine, and thus a good core loss sometimes cannot be obtained.\n\nEP 2 698 441 A1\n9\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\nEXAMPLE\n[0042]Next, experiments conducted by the present inventors will be explained. The conditions and so on in these\nexperiments are examples employed for confirming the applicability and effects of the present invention, and the present\ninvention is not limited to these examples.\n[0043]First, steels each containing Si: 3.3%, Mn: 0.10%, Al: 0.8%, N: 0.002%, and Cu: 1.2%, and further Ni having\na content listed in Table 2, and S having a content listed in Table 2, in which a balance is composed of Fe and inevitable\nimpurities, were melted in a vacuum melting furnace in a laboratory, and a steel billet (slab) was made from each of the\nsteels. Then, each of the steel billets was heated at 1100°C for 60 minutes and was subjected to hot rolling immediately,\nwhereby hot-rolled sheets each having a thickness of 2.0 mm were obtained. Thereafter, each of the hot-rolled sheets\nwas subjected to hot-rolled sheet annealing at 1020°C for 60 seconds, pickling, and one time of cold rolling, whereby\ncold-   rolled sheets each having a thickness of 0.30 mm were obtained. Subsequently, each of the cold-rolled sheets was\nsubjected to finish annealing at 900°C for 45 seconds.\n[0044]Then, a number density of sulfide in each of obtained non-oriented electrical steel sheets was measured. At\nthis time, an object to be measured was one having a circle-equivalent diameter of not less than 0.1 mm nor more than\n1.0 mm. Further, a yield stress, a fracture elongation, and a core loss were also measured. As the core loss, a core loss\nW10/400 was measured.
